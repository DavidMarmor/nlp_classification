Hey everyone I am a Freshman in college attending San Jose state and I am just wondering what is the best way to get into sports analytics?,Sabermetrics
"As I'm sure you have heard, the [MLB recently cracked down](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-foreign-substance-crack-down-six-things-to-know-about-baseballs-sticky-situation/) on pitchers' use of foreign substances. Using Baseball Savant, I have noticed that many pitchers have seen noticeable declines in RPMs for almost every pitch. 

I would like to see the statistical significance of these declines. 

For example, on June 10th, [these were the declines of Aroldis Chapman's](https://imgur.com/a/O0Pjnl0) pitches on the blown save versus the Twins. 

What would be the easiest way to determine if these drops are statistically significant? 

Here are some other examples:

"Trying to do some analysis in R with baseballR. I had been using the built in functions to scrape Statcast and Baseball Reference Data for pitchers. When I go to join in a player's name based on the ID, I always get a match but get the WRONG match. It literally seem like BBR and Savant have been using the same set of unique player ID values, but randomizing which player belongs to each. Am I stupid or just high? It always matches a pitcher but a DIFFERENT pitcher who is not even on either team.

"Hello guys, I’m back to ask a few questions, I work with my schools baseball team and they said that they wanted me to include outcomes in my markov chain, as in, just simulating pitches wasn’t enough they wanted to know, what kind of pitch sequence would produce a specific outcomes, such as an out, strike, etc.

In other words, what sequence of pitches has the highest probability in yielding a specific outcome.

My first through was to use a hidden markov model, saying my hidden states are pitch types “fastball, curveball, change up, slider”, and my observed variables are the specific outcomes (strike, double play, out, etc)

That way I can get the sequence with the max probability of yielding a specific outcome that’s observed. 


For example the coach told me “our main pitcher had 7 strike outs one game using the same sequence of curveball,slider, curveball, and he usually has a weak curveball, so we don’t know how that happened but if there’s a pattern between what outcome there is and the specific sequence, we want to know which sequence had the highest chance at yielding strikes or outs”


So would this be a good opportunity for using a hidden markov model? Any other suggestions?",Sabermetrics

"Hi guys. I'm trying to work on a project to compare the true talent levels of different division I college baseball players, and I am running into a problem that I may be overthinking, but I need some advice. I am currently in the process of collecting all the data baseline stats (hits, HRs, K's, normal counting stats), and with those, I can then calculate more advanced stats such as ISO, wOBA, FIP, etc. My issue with these stats is that each conference premieres a vastly different level of performance. For example, maintaining a wOBA of .400 in a league like the SEC is significantly more impressive than a .400 wOBA in the Horizon League. This would be similar to if the scoring environments were different in the AL and NL in the MLB, but they are not different enough to warrant different statistical measurements. In college, however, they are, and it is even more apparent this season, where many conferences did not allow a non-conference schedule.

A common solution for this is to use league-adjusted stats like wRC+ that control for league and park effect. These stats seem to be made for exactly my scenario (and they may indeed be what I'm looking for), but there is still something about them that I am still struggling with: A wRC+ of 150 in the SEC should also be more impressive than a wRC+ of 150 in the Horizon League. 

Basically, I am looking for stats that are not as much league-adjusted, but more opponent-adjusted or environment-adjusted. I feel like the league-adjusted stats should account for this, but I still feel like I will run into the problem I describe above. Am I missing something about how league-adjusted stats work, or are there some other stats I could use to fix this issue? Also, if anyone else has worked on a project like this I would love to see what you have done! Thanks!",Sabermetrics

"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to derive wOBA for a fictional fantasy baseball league, and have come across a functional question about RE24 and baserunner/out situations. I will try my best to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's say that an inning is led off with a home run in the first PA, starting off with bases empty and 0 outs. Then, in the next PA (with bases empty and 0 outs again), a batter hits a double, and he would be the only other run to score in the inning.

&amp;#x200B;

As I have it right now, the expected runs produced for no runners on and 0 outs would be 3, because the first situation with no runners on and no outs resulted in one run on the play and one run to come in the inning, and the 2nd PA resulted in one run on the play and no runs later in the inning, hence the count of three.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is, for duplicate baserunner and out count situations in the same inning, do you just take the highest value and discard the duplicate? If not, it would result in a higher expected run count than there are total runs scored.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope I did an adequate job of explaining my problem, any feedback is much appreciated.",Sabermetrics

"Hello!

I am currently working on my master thesis and need WAR data from 2015-2020. I've found some data on different sites as baseball-reference and ESPN but i there are some obstacles.

1. Some sites only have e.g top 5 players (with regards to WAR)
2. Some sites demand web scraping ( time consuming, and messy)

My question is, are there any places where it is easy to download this kind of data?

note: I am new to baseball and sabermetrics, and have downloaded full dataset from statcast(all the variables available on the website). Are all the variables needed to calculate war in that dataset?

If all the variables are in the dataset i dont have any problem calculating it myself.

"With pitching stats, it’s easy for the stat to not accurately reflect the player. For instance, everyone knows of the issues with ERA. There are stats that try and deal with the issues that others have, but they all have some weaknesses. I had an idea for a stat that I think would eliminate a lot of those weaknesses. 

My proposed stat would be very similar to FIP in purpose, but different in calculation. Instead of relying on a league average number and then having an equation, here is how my stat would be calculated:

For every ball hit into play, a system analyzes all the different factors of the ball, especially velocity and position. Then it calculates whether or not the league average player would be able to field that play. Then it assigns a value to that ball put into play based on how likely it is to be fielded. It will also be weighted for how many bases the runner is expected to get on each play. The system’s purpose is to analyze every play and determine what the average outcome is, in order to judge the pitcher correctly.

I know it’s kind of lame to end this here without any proof of concept or even any numbers, but this is a hypothetical stat. I wish I knew how to code, because then I could work on this, but alas I cannot. I figured I should share it though in case it sparks anyone else’s imagination or if anyone wants to try and make this",Sabermetrics

I've had a statistical modeling project going for several years now. My goal is to create a model that (reasonably) accurately predicts MLB hitter performance in the upcoming year. This began as a final project for a stats class I took while I was in college and is something that I've updated and improved every year. 2 months into the season I'm fairly happy with my results. These two charts show my results, and I added Statcast's xwOBA for reference (interestingly, xwOBA from 2020 has only been a fraction of a percentage point more predictive than a hitter's wRC+ from 2020, which is supported by previous years results as well. I think Statcast has a lot of interesting data, but I think all of their xStats for offense are junk). These charts include all MLB hitters who received at least 50 PA's in both 2020 and 2021. It's worth noting that it may not be fair to compare my model with xwOBA, since xwOBA only includes 2020 data, while mine is using the previous 6 months of baseball (7/24/2019-5/24/2021). I haven't found a way to find a batter's xwOBA over a multi-year timeframe. However, limiting my model to just 2020 data still results in an R\^2 value of about 0.095, which is still quite a bit more predictive than xwOBA. Based on previous year's data, I predict that my model will have an R\^2 of about 0.22-0.30 at the end of the season for hitters with a minimum of at least 200 PA's in both years, compared to xwOBA, which is usually 0.13-0.15.

The model was created differently this year. Previously, I would take as much data as I possibly could for hitter's of a selected sample size, as well as the hitter's wRC+ in the following season, and create a regression model predicting the next year's wRC+. This led to a ton of bias in my results, and my actual R\^2 each year was maybe \~60% of what my predicted R\^2 was. This year, I took all hitters who compiled a minimum of 1000 PA's in the Statcast era, and used data such as swing rates, contact stats, and sprint speed to predict the player's wRC+ during that time period. I consider this to be a ""true talent"" calculation. I used the regression formula calculated by that model to create a prediction for what every player (min 250 PA's in two consecutive seasons) should have done in year one, and then took that prediction along with other variables (such as handedness, age, park factors) to predict how that player performed in the following season. This resulted in a significantly stronger fit with much less bias.

There are some issues with the model. The range of predictions it gives is almost entirely in the 80-120 range, which is obviously much narrower than is seen in a real season, and makes me question how useful the model actually is, since the difference between an average prediction and a positive prediction is so slight. Additionally, I've noticed a weird trend where the model seems to predict hot streaks. For example, last year Dylan Carlson was bad, but the model said he'd be good this year. This year, Carlson has been good, but now the model says he won't sustain it. I've noticed this trend with a number of other players in previous seasons as well. I don't have data confirming this, and I don't know that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it is an interesting observation. I also think the model probably weights batted ball data (barrel rate, etc) too heavily, which makes me think some of it's predictions are bound to regress and makes me wonder how quickly it'll stabilize, but FWIW all test I've done indicates it stabilizes much quicker than xwOBA or the previous years data. And then lastly, it is a very simple model. I think this is both a good and bad thing. My regression analysis professor stressed that the best model is always the simplest one that gets you closest to the max fit from the data you have, but I do wonder if a more accurate and useful fit could be achieved by increasing the data used by the model. Currently, I think it only uses like 10 total variables.",Sabermetrics
"I’m keeping track of stats for my softball team, and trying to measure offensive stats. The problem is this league has a HR limit of 4 per game. So it’s important to hit them strategically. If we’ve reached our HR limit it automatically counts as 3 outs. Therefore if someone uses up 4 home runs for solo shots, it can harm us later in a game. But at the same time if it’s late in the game and we haven’t used them up yet, a solo shot can also help. 

I know OBP is generally agreed upon as the best stat for measuring offense. But in this league Selfish players hitting solo shots should not have as high of a OPS as someone that is getting on base more. 

What adjusted formula would you recommend using? It would be nice to come up with the ultimate stat that also factors in runs scored and RBI’s into this to show overall offense value",Sabermetrics
"Hi, have had this thought in the back of my mind for awhile but never asked:

How does the calculation for inherited runners work? Cause I was doing some digging and found something that doesn't quite make sense to me.

All calculations I've found for for RA9 are basically ERA but get rid of the distinction between earned and unearned, that's great I agree for the most part, but it seems like runners left on base that score because of a reliever get charged to the pitcher who left them there and not the pitcher who allowed them to score which doesn't really make sense to me since it allows another player to affect your value (however small) and allows a relief pitcher to allow runs scoring without taking any type of hit to their value (however small). The Pitching WAR page on baseball reference doesn't acknowledge this situation.

Blake Treinen has his RA9 based on 6 runs allowed during 19 innings pitched this season for an RA9 of 2.84. However he allowed an inherited runner to score on 4/24 that got charged to Victor Gonzalez and doesn't at all count toward his RA9.

I get that WAR is designed to be context neutral, but it seems like a potentially big issue for that context neutrality if you had 2 pitchers who had similar lines and left runners on base when they existed games but one had a lights out bullpen while the other has a terrible pen. If RA9 is calculated like I think it is, then doesn't bullpen quality have the potential to affect a pitcher's bWAR in a significant way?

I'm sure in the grand scheme of things it doesn't have any significant effect on players... but it does seem like there is potential for a huge mismatch in specific circumstances... maybe we should grade relievers on how well they strand inherited runners (ala the extra innings RA9 calculations) and give pitchers a league average strand rate when calculating their RA9 instead of using the actual runs charged to them? 

Thanks for any clarity y'all can provide.",Sabermetrics

Rather than just formulating an opinion-based answer to the question based on judgement, is there a stat that measures the ""RBI Opportunity"" of a given stretch?

And after digging in on various company practices, I just wanted to share that they may be substantially worse. 

A while back, I thought to myself that working with an MLB team with the crazy hours I was working wouldn’t be sustainable. And that if I didn’t catch a break, working with a tech company would allow me to stay around the game and work more manageable hours. So, I got a job. It was steady for a little and then COVID hit. And again, without being too specific, the way I was treated sort of from Day 1 was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me.

I was blatantly misclassified for tax reasons. The people in charge were brilliant, but awful business people. The technology was amazing. It was cool to be on the ground floor of a smaller rising operation (they’re all small and gaining clients exponentially). But, one day you’d be promised no issues with furloughs or that they will fulfill the terms of your contract. The next day, you were furloughed for months on end and at the end of your contract, you were told that you couldn’t be paid your last owed check until the following year. 

Companies were hit hard in this industry by COVID. But, the lack of human empathy just baffled me. I was furloughed for quite a while, and as I was frustrated I wouldn’t be receiving my last paycheck, I saw my company posting about adding more clients, giving entire systems away, and getting all this good press. It wasn’t just me either. An entire new team of hires was dropped suddenly. Everyone was promised communication but never heard again after furlough. Dropped. Many MLB teams who had to drop interns or seasonal employees brought them back into the fold in 2021. I was promised more due to my experience and waited a long time. No word. Nothing around Christmas, nothing on New Years to forecast what’s up, nothing before teams went to camp. I let the company treat me poorly because I loved baseball and the tech. But imagine being brought on to a job, and being furloughed sucks enough. But on top of that, having NO communication ever again. None of us ever heard back. And they hired new people without ever consulting us to see if we were on the market. I shouldn’t care because I moved on, but it was crushing after all I’ve done and the reputation I built thus far. 

Then afterward, I did some digging on other companies. Not all of them. But many. Similar stories. One of the most renowned companies in the field that I spoke to this winter were one of the most disorganized work environments I’ve seen. Low pay, no career path, and your work hours are seldom better, being at the beck and call of teams. Who are immensely needy to the point I’ve had friends tells me with companies that they’d have to start reports at 10pm after wing promised 9-5 hours. Teams are fun to work for directly, not on the outside.  

I know this was long, I need to rant. I felt really hurt. To be told great job and then ghosted. Even if a job goes poorly, you get fired and it’s closure. These companies just are profoundly awful. Not ALL of them, but after a lot of research and talking to folks, it felt prevalent. If you want to work in baseball, just be with a team. Intern, go in with the risks. At least then you know what you signed up for. But for those who thought like I did that being around baseball with these companies is a good replacement, it’s not. It’s all the bad things about being with a team in a completely soulless atmosphere.",Sabermetrics
"On baseball savants csv definition page it's plainly defined as ""Vertical movement in feet from the catcher's perpsective"" but this doesn't align with the ""vertical movement in inches"" that is shown on player profiles.

"
Elvis Andrus has always been mediocre. I have to say that because from 2009 to 2012 he was an average to above average defender but since has been an outright below average to poor defender. If you’re a casual fan and take a look at his career slash line of .272/.328/.370 with a 14% K rate you may think ‘well there’s a okay hitter’ but then you pull back the curtain a bit and peek at his wRC+ and see he’s only been an *average* hitter twice. The reality is he’s been a cap casualty ever since 2018 when he was 29.

I’m not writing this to say oh look at his wRC+ it hasn’t been good therefore ‘he bad.’ The same thing you find with Elvis Andrus is the same thing you find with Albert Pujols or Chris Davis or Khris Davis or any number of hitters. I have found roughly 3 major ways of being able to project whether a hitters best days are behind him before we are faced with the startling reality at the plate. The most common key to expected regression is looking at Pitch Value/100, after aprox. 3,000  career plate appearances if a guy has a season in which two or more pitches he sees more than 2% of the time have a value of -1.4 or worse and an overall CSW of 25%+ then congratulations you’ve found a hitter scheduled for regression. 


Chris Davis experienced it in 2016, a season in which he finished with 38 HRs, the following year he regressed to a 91 wRC+ before absolutely collapsing. Khris Davis experienced it in 2018, a year in which he had 48 HRs and has since been very not good. Pujols succumb to it in 2017, a year in which he had already regressed from the previous due to a different regress commonly found in older hitters. Elvis Andrus experienced it in 2018, a season which appeared be a simple regress to the mean for a fairly young player but was in fact a sign that his usefulness at the plate was close to over. 


It’s worth noting that going into 2020 two of the biggest disappointments in Christian Yelich and JD Martinez showed no signs of slowing down, and given they both saw less than 250 plate appearances it shouldn’t be indicative of their future at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

Going off 2019 stats here are some guys expected for this type of regression:

&amp;nbsp;

Lorenzo Cain – Brewers – Current wRC+: 90

Manny Machado – Padres – Current wRC+: 105

Freddy Galvis – Orioles – Current wRC+: 116

Jose Abreu – White Sox – Current wRC+: 130

"Any current or historical examples you can think of?  

My favourite historical example is Joe DiMaggio. He was erroneously called the ‘greatest living ball-player’ and lionized by the New York media. Had he played elsewhere he would not have been as much of a cultural icon. In that sense, he was OVERrated. 

However, he also happened to play in a park that handicapped him more than any great righty power hitter, ever. 

His career splits at the ol’ Yankee Stadium: .315/.391/.546

On the road: .333/.405/.610

Gosh, was that park ever death for right-handed hitters in those days. Joe D, for what it’s worth, out-averaged Ted Williams on the road and slugged only .005 worse. Granted, the OBP was substantially in Williams favour, but still! Some people consider Williams the greatest hitter ever and JD hit with as much power as him on the road. I can’t think of an all-time great more penalized by their home park. I wonder about the approximate effect it had on his career WAR. If he played in practically any other park and didn’t lose 3 seasons to WW2 I think it’s plausible he’d have amassed 110-120 career WAR. 110-120 WAR in 16 years would be incredible. For that reason I think he’s a tad underrated by the analytics community, which tends to rank him in the low 20s nowadays. 

One might say, ‘park factors! They adjust for this stuff’ — well, no, not quite. OYS was a graveyard for righty power hitters, but on aggregate it was not a pitchers park. The short right field porch benefitted lefties substantially. It does not adjust for handedness. 

Now, while I’m a SABRhead I deviate a little from some orthodoxies when ranking players by placing more importance on skill and adjusting for vagaries and happenstance than some. Yes, career value is the most important thing to consider, sure. But, I look at someone like DiMaggio and can’t help but think his skill level exceeded his statistics or accumulated career value (which is legendarily great even with 3 lost prime seasons, 83.6 fWAR) and not for nebulous reasons like ‘he just didn’t live up to his potential’, ‘his head wasn’t screwed on right’, but for some freak anomaly that is 

a) quantifiable 

b) not adjusted for by overall park factor and thus not reflected in his career WAR

c) wholly out of his control 

Does DiMaggio magically become a better or more skilled baseball player if he hits at, say Fenway his entire career, where he hit .334/.415/.605 (80 points better than his OPS at home against the Sox)? No! He also doesn’t win all those World Series. Yet, he becomes orders of magnitude more VALUABLE. And that applies to him playing in every other American League park than the one he was unlucky enough to hit in. 

While one can also say ‘b-but he should have adjusted!’ — that’s technically true but pushing the limits of what is reasonable to expect from a right-handed power hitter playing in a home park historically unsuited to his talents. Rings similar to ‘pull yourself up by the bootstraps’ — obvious advice, but hollow. No righty power hitter did. Joe Gordon was LESS of a power/pull hitter than Joe yet he ‘adjusted’ as poorly, if not worse. 

The inverse of this is Jimmie Foxx. He is unanimously remembered as the better hitter, and maybe he was (it could be that he adjusted his swing to his park to such a degree that it radically altered his road stats) but look at his home/road splits: 

Home: .345/.454/.664 

Road: .307/.405/.560

Joe has 50 road OPS points on him. They are both right-handed pull hitters, but one played in offensively robust parks for righties, the other did not. Taking their overall stats at face value and pretending one adjusted and one did not seems like willful ignorance. Joe is a better hitter and a top 10-15 all-time player, not top 20-30 or any of that jazz. I know gifting unearned career value is like printing money, but I can’t ignore my eyes here and pretend Joe D. is in the Jimmie Foxx tier all-time.  


Just my (radically unorthodox) take. 

TL;DR: Joe D. is better than his stats suggest but not cuz of ‘aura’ or ‘Yankee mystique’, it’s cuz through sheer misfortune he played in a park historically tough on righty power hitters which is unaccounted for by park factors.

"Hey guys,

So I'm currently trying to derive linear weights in a fictional fantasy baseball league that I play in, but I hit a snag in [this fangraphs tutorial](https://library.fangraphs.com/the-beginners-guide-to-deriving-woba/) on how to derive it. To save y'all the time with having to load the page, here is the paragraph:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Scaling

\&gt; We have the runs above average for walks (0.29), HBP (0.31), singles (0.44), doubles (0.74), triples (1.01), and home runs (1.39), but what we want to do now is put wOBA on a scale that will look like OBP. In OBP, an out is worth zero, so the first thing we want to do is adjust the run value scale so that an out is equal to zero.

\&gt; There is an easy way to do this. First, we need to find the linear weight for all outs using the same method we used to find the value for the other events. We’ll call it -0.26 for 2015. This means that an out is worth -0.26 runs less than the average PA when it comes to run expectancy. What we want to do now is add 0.26 to each of our run values so that outs are equal to zero. So for walks, which we said are worth 0.29 runs above average, we bump those up to 0.55 runs *relative to an out*. Using linear weights, walks are worth 0.55 runs more than outs. We repeat this for each of the five other positive offensive outcomes.

*(Something I should note, I am only collecting data in the 8th inning and earlier to avoid walk-offs that leave incomplete innings.)*

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should I do? My best guess would be to collect the sum of all the negative RE24 plays and divide it by the sum of all the outs made, but that doesn't sound right (A double with the bases loaded that scores two runs but the runner from 1st getting thrown out would be an out-producing play, but still generate positive RE24). So, I'm just looking for other tutorials right now and thought it would be a good idea to make a post on here because you guys have been so wonderfully helpful in the past on my prior account.

"I’ve been recently downloading data using the pybaseball

    team_game_logs()

function.  This function returns data regarding each game of the season, based on year and team.  For example,

    team_game_logs(2021, ‘NYM’)

will return data for each game of the Mets 2021 season so far.  Batting results are the default returned values, but my searches have been ‘pitching’ to return pitching data by each game, such as 

    team_game_logs(2021, ‘NYM’, ‘pitching’)

The data includes typical pitching stats, such as IP, H, R, ER, UER, BB, etc.  The last column from this download includes a column, ‘PitchersUsed’, which lists the pitchers that played in the game and they are listed in the order in which they appeared.  Additionally, each pitcher has more information specific to them.  Most obvious are the letter codes, W for win, L for loss, Sv for save, and so on.  However, the pitchers have numbers listed before any of the letter codes.  For example, when looking at the data from the 2021 Mets, the first several games of the ‘PitchersUsed’ column includes

    J.deGrom (99-71), M.Castro (99-H), T.May (99-L), A.Loup (99-BSv)
    M.Stroman (99-63-W), M.Castro (0), T.May (0), J.Familia (99)
    D.Peterson (99-27-L), J.Barnes (99), D.Betances (99), J.Lucchesi (99)
    T.Walker (99-58), M.Castro (1), T.May (1), E.Diaz (99-W)
    J.deGrom (4-82-L), E.Diaz (1), J.Familia (3)
    

The first row is the first Mets game of 2021.  The pitchers for the Mets, in order, include deGrom, Castro, May and Loup.  A.Loup blew the save in game one.  However, I cannot find any information regarding the numbers in the parentheses, such as J.deGrom (99-71).  The numbers do not appear to correlate with batters faced, number of pitches thrown, innings pitched, number of strikes/balls, pitcher appearance for the year, etc.  I’m stumped because I don’t know what these numbers refer to.

&amp;#x200B;

The pybaseball library does not include any information about these numbers, that I can find.  This data comes from, I believe, Baseball Reference and I cannot identify any information from their website regarding these numbers.  In fact, it looks like Baseball Reference may also get historical data from Retrosheet, and again, I cannot identify any information about this through their website.  The first numbers of the year (in the example above) all have 99 as the initial number listed, such as M.Stroman (99-63-W) in the second Mets game of the season, which is his first appearance of the season, and in which Stroman got the win.  This 99 appears to be a code for the first appearance of the season for the pitcher.  After that, any obvious sequence evades me.  In fact, some of these identifying codes are listed as single numbers, like J.Familia(3), while others are dashed, like J.deGrom(4-82-L).  In searching of BR, Retrosheet, and pybaseball docs, I have not found any list of codes.

metricB = (wOBA + metricA) /2                              -&gt; Average of metricA and players weighted OBA

metricC = (SB / PA) \* .10                                          -&gt; SB per PA with a minimal weight applied

playerScore = metricB + metricC

I used these numbers on some current and past players to evaluate their seasons. I found that an average score was around a 6.65, so someone in the 6 range is average. I found that Mike Trout's MVP season in 2019 was an 8.28, so someone in the 8 range is an MVP level. This is also backed up by the fact that JD Martinez currently has a score of 8.22, which makes sense because he is having an excellent season. Lastly, I wanted to find how high the score could go. I found that Ted William's 1941 season scored a perfect 10.04, which I figure is the absolute best someone could do. (The only season higher was Barry Bond's 2004 season in which he got a 10.41, but for obvious reasons his numbers are thrown out).

One of the projects that BA has started working on a MySQL that contains play by play, pitch by pitch data for MLB, LatAm winter leagues( LBPRC, LBVP, LMP, LIDOM ) and Mexican leagues(LMB). On top of that, the database contains (open source) stored procedures that calculate interesting such as REM24, Run Value, wOBA, FIP, Win Expectancy, Park Factors and aggregated data(at several levels). This way by having both the data and the code, people can carry out their own analysis and can understand( and most importantly, reproduce ) advance stats.

As of today we have data from 2006 to 2020 and the way we get the data is by using MLB's StatsApi. By doing so, we have access to some awesome information( which ofc we store in the database) like:

* Pitch Type ( MLB only )
* Pitch Location( X, Y coordinates)
* BIP location( X.Y coordinates)

Hello all, I’m a student working for my college baseball team doing some analysis on their game data. We have scraped game data for the team from the NCAA website and are interested in the pitch sequence. The current data contains stats such as the specific pitcher, the outcome, batter, order number, hitter number, inning, whether it was top or bottom, and many others.

We have been tasked to take this game data from 2019-2021 and try and find some relationship between the variables and pitch sequences.

An example, one of the rows of data contains “KBFK”
In the pitch sequence column, indicating that as the pitch sequence, ( I don’t watch nor play baseball so I don’t know what this means, I’m just helping from the stats side).

Now that I have given some context, I will give u ab idea of my plan, without getting too technical we want to figure out which of these variables are mostly predictive of, or have some sort of relationship to the pitch sequence, obviously data cleaning will be done before any model fitting, but my next question is

What else besides knowing a pitch sequence could be useful? Cool we find out that on a given hit or batter the pitch sequence KBFK occurs, but what more can we do with this?

Can I maybe go deeper and predict the next pitch? Or the pitch on a given situation?

This is fine when computing the leverage for each inning or for each base-out state, since there are many observations in each group.  But if I want to account for inning, base-out state, and score simultaneously, then I will inevitably have some states that have only occurred once.  (e.g. A 6 run lead in the 1st with 2 outs and runners on 1B and 3B).  In this case, sd(abs(WPA)) returns NA).

Is there an explicit way to calculate LI for a given inning-base-out-score state?  I assume there are several versions of LI, but I'm struggling to find an actual formula and not just the broad logic.",Sabermetrics

"Baseball Reference is kind enough to dump its WAR calculations on an [almost nightly basis](https://www.baseball-reference.com/data/).

During the MLB season, they have some periods where they do not put out a new file, like the All Star Break. They also don't put out WAR data for the first 8-10 days of a season; I'm guessing that is to establish a decent sample size and weights.

But there are also individual days where they don't put out data, which occur on a fairly regular basis—typically Mondays. I have a project where I want to use the daily WAR data, but the gaps in continuity make it a little tough. I'm trying to figure out why BR does that.

One theory I have is that Mondays tend to be travel days for teams, and there are fewer games that day. So perhaps a disproportionate number of good or bad teams playing that day could throw off weights? That doesn't seem right, though, if enough data underpins the weights.

My other, best theory is simply that Monday is just their day off at BR.

Any ideas?",Sabermetrics
"Follow-up post to original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/p6ipr4/does_weighting_previous_seasons_increase_the/

I've made changes to my methodology to address the issues that commenters raised. For one, I've switched the sample from 2018-2020 to 2016-2018, using 2019 as the dependent variable instead of 2021. This addresses both the issue of the 60-game 2020 season, as well as using a full season of data for the dependent variable rather than the in-progress 2021 season.

Next, also on the recommendation of /u/jamminontheone, I've switched the weighting from 5-3-1 to 5-4-3, as Tom Tango's Marcel projections proposed in 2004.

Here were the results of the regressions:



Test Case | R^2 | Std. Error | t-value | p-value
---------|---|-------|-------|------
Naked Total (1/1/1) | 0.469 | 0.050 | 5.635 | 2.1e-06
Weighted Total (5/4/3) | 0.474 | 0.012 | 5.692 | 1.8e-06

These numbers make a LOT more sense than my initial attempt at analysis. The statistical significance of both test cases is much stronger, in both cases exceeding a confidence level of 99.999%. Both also have a stronger correlation with the dependent variable.

We see that weighting the seasons on a 5/4/3 basis provides a slightly better correlation, with almost a 5x reduction in the standard error. Obviously a +- 0.05 to wRC+ isn't an issue since it's usually represented as an integer value, but clearly weighting does provide a statistically significant advantage for projection purposes, if a small one.",Sabermetrics

"One thing I've seen recommended in the Fangraphs Library is that when using a player's statistics to try and predict their future performance, given a sample of three seasons, those past three seasons should be given weights of 1, 3, and 5 from least recent to most recent season, to account for the fact that a player changes over time.

To test this, I loaded up R Studio and baseballr and pulled the seasonal wRC+ stats for batters that qualified in every season from 2018 to 2021, giving a sample of 37 batters. I've performed two linear regressions using the 2021 wRC+ of these batters as the dependent variable; the first regression uses the regular mean average of the 2018-2020 seasons for that batter as the independent variable, and the second regression uses the weighted mean where 2018 is weighted 1, 2019 is weighted 3, and 2020 is weighted 5. Here are the results of these regressions below:



Test Case | R^2 | Std. Error | t-value | p-value
---------|----------|-------|-------|-------
Weighted Average (1/3/5) | 0.111 | 0.171 | 2.085 | 0.044
Regular Average (1/1/1) | 0.156 | 0.206 | 2.547 | 0.015

What we can see is that the weighted average has a lower correlation than the regular average, contrary to what Fangraphs' recommendation would suggest. The p-values show that the recommended average also has a notably higher level of statistical significance, and is well within the 95% probability threshold.

Am I missing something here, or did Fangraphs make a mistake suggesting a weighted average for career stats?",Sabermetrics

I’m trying to think of a good way to visualize these changes beyond a simple line or bar graph. I want to display some kind of league wide change in pull, power, LA, really anything. I’m familiar with doing spray charts, heat maps, radial graphs for individual players - but it’s obviously harder to see change from the league as a whole.

"For some time I’ve played around with FanGraphs WAR calculation to better understand how it works. Recently I’ve modified it some to see what would happen with the results.

First was substituting our UZR for OAA as the defensive metric. I really enjoy the idea of OAA and what it represents. 

I also thought about it and didn’t think that the defensive and offensive metrics shouldn’t weigh the same. When you have a player who accumulates 600 PA but only makes 300 attempts at fielding the view, shouldn’t the batting weigh more? All I did here was get the percentage of plays for offense and defense, divided it by .5 to get a modifier. Here is an example:

Player A has 561 PA and made 495 attempts in the field. That would mean this player is responsible in 1,056 plays, 53.1% offensive, 46.9% defensive. Dividing each percent in half, offensive side gets a 1.063 modifier and defensive a .938.

Using that, this would be the new fWAR equation:

(((Batting Runs + Base Running Runs)*1.063)+((Fielding Runs + Positional Adjustment)*0..938) + League Adjustment + Replacement Runs) / Runs Per Win

I ran each of these individually and together to compare it to the FanGraphs way of doing it against the four big SS who will be free agents at years end and it was interesting to see the changes. 

The modifiers had far less of a play in these calculations — but only depending on what you use for the number of attempts. Since I was using OAA, I used the attempts that baseballsavant had listed. However if I used Plays listed under FanGraphs, it went from a near 50/50 split to 75/25 favoring offense. 

Using OAA, however, made a large difference. Someone like Javier Baez who had a 10.0 UZR in 2019 but a +32 OAA at SS would see 2 full wins added to his total. Likewise, Trevor Story this year has seen nearly a full win drop off his total using OAA.

With that being said, while I find todays advanced metrics fascinating, I do not have a full scope of this area of the game as the people in this community do. I don’t even know what R and python really are but I find the idea of running numbers myself really interesting. But enough about all of that, here’s what I’ve come up with. 


You’re all familiar with the Quality Start metric. 6 or more innings, no more than 3 runs surrendered. But what makes up those starts? Innings. 

QIP. Quality Innings Percentage. 

How does one determine what a quality inning is? Here’s what I think.

-15 pitches or less

-No more than one BB

-No more than one hit

-2 or less base runners in general?

-No earned runs

-No hard hit balls or barrels

What I think something like this would bring to the table is a pretty decent snapshot of a pitchers efficiency and dominance throughout the course of a season. You could look at there QIP at home vs. away. Day games vs. night games. How that number moves through the duration of 162. Does fatigue reflect in these numbers, etc. 

Now I would like some brutal honesty and some constructive criticism from the number gurus in this subreddit. Is this a redundant stat? Does it offer anything new? What could be done to make it operate better? And lastly, what in the hell does the formula look like? I have thought about this constantly over the last week and am really just looking to start some dialogue on this idea. Thanks for reading!",Sabermetrics

"Basically, I wonder if any given batter has a better chance of getting hit in their first try against the same pitcher or in a second or third go-around until the bullpen comes in.

I can't find anything here or on pro baseball reference that points to it and that could really be interesting to prove or disprove whether it's better to pull a starter on the first cycle of the batting order once a certain number of hits are on the board.

Off the top of my head, I feel as if it has to rise cumulatively as the hitter gets more used to the pitch selection but this could be one of those counterintuitive things where they actually do better on the first frame.",Sabermetrics
"I was fiddling around today was looking for a convenient way to accurately rank offensive performance without resorting to computational analysis. Knowing that the key issue with OPS is that OBP is underweighted compared to SLG, I was wondering if simply adding in AVG to the mix (AVG+OBP+SLG) would improve it.

Superficially, it roughly weights BB/1B/2B/3B/HR in the same broad scales as LW with 1B being overweighted and 2B being underweighted. However, this seems to a convenient canceling out of effects for players that do not have abnormal 1B/2B ratios.

Anyway, I realize that I am not the first person to think of this, so I am wondering if any studies have been done about the relative accuracy of AVG+OBP+SLG (or more simply AVG+OPS when OPS is available) compared to more advanced metrics.

The reason for this is that I always seem to have a slash line available for players everywhere, but none of the variety of more computationally-depedent metrics. So if AVG+OPS has a 90% correlation to those metrics, that would be very useful to know.",Sabermetrics

"I'm new to python, but I'm learning by redoing my spreadsheets as a program so this may be more of a python question than a pybaseball question but here goes!

`data.head()`

"Hi, I'm a baseball fan from Mexico who's interested in statistics, sabermetrics and all these new things that are coming out and changing how we see and play baseball. However, it seems like the leagues this side of the border (namely, Liga Mexicana de Beisbol and Liga Mexicana del Pacífico) haven't caught up, or at least there's no way for the general public to see these kind of stats (on sites like Fangraphs, Baseball Savant and others).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to at least attempt to calculate a couple of these advanced stats, at least the ""basic"" ones like FIP and WAR.

"I am trying to dive into defensive metrics to analyze players at each position but I am quickly becoming confused. 

In my comparison, I am looking at Austin Riley and Nolan Arenado. Nolan is largely considered to be the best defensive 3B in the game and has been for quite some time. Riley is an up and coming star with (to the eye test) above average defensive ability. However, if we look at their defensive #'s, they don't tell a clear story.

https://preview.redd.it/484gtgm7osz71.png?width=361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b81a32a865080f3bef2bebe1c40aa39a24dac815

rPM attempts to quantify the ability to convert a batted ball into an out and Fangraphs has Riley as a MUCH better defender in this category. The same is said about DRS for Riley.

Looking at UZR however, this would indicate that Riley is a well below average defender at 3B. UZR is more widely used as the go to for defensive ability as it combines 

What factor am I missing here? Is this just a case of ""defense is too hard to quantify in baseball""? What other metric should I be looking at to analyze and compare defensive ability? Is DRS more reliable because it accounts for factors that UZR does not such as GFP/DME, ball velo/angle, etc.?",Sabermetrics

I am currently doing a statistics project for one of my classes where I am looking at different pitching metrics of Cardinals pitchers from this season before and after June 3rd 2021.

For example, Genesis Cabrera pitched in 26 games before June 3rd, but there are only 20 entries on Baseball Savant for his swinging strike percent. Should I take this to mean that he had 6 games with zero swinging strikes, or that there is not data on 6 games?

"I was arguing with my Dad earlier about how wrc+ works, and showing him that based on park and era adjusted stats, Babe Ruth ranks as the most effective hitter in history. However he had a take on the stat calling it bullshit.

His argument is that those factors dont take into account the fact that some players, ex pitchers, back then had to go work a job in the day, exhaust themselves, then go to the field and play 9 innings, making them not play to their full capacity. While players like Babe Ruth dont need to work every day to make a living, giving him time to practice and play better every day.

What is his flaw in his thinking? I know that a tired pitcher not playing well will obviously decrease the league average statistic, but not knowing how good a player could be if they didn't have to work is what he thinks makes the stat stupid.

Anyone?? Anywhere?? Where did this stat go from 2 years ago?,Sabermetrics
"I've been learning about change point detection, and wanted to try applying one of the algorithms (specifically, Bayesian Online Change Point Detection) to a real world question. Very quickly, the BOCPD model basically takes a set of input variables and asks, what is the probability that the ""run length"" - time since the last change point is equal to x at each time step. If the highest probability run length is zero, you have a change point.

The idea is this: The underlying talent level and run scoring dynamics of MLB aren't really going to change year-to-year. The yearly changes we see in, say, league OBP are likely just fluctuations around some ""true talent"" level. This will of course drift over time, but that process should be pretty gradual. However, there may be discrete changes - expansion, rule changes, a different ball - that change either the league's talent level, or run scoring dynamics.

The practical use of this might be that we can take the eras of offense, if they exist, and fit linear weights for wOBA specific to that era, rather than that season. We wouldn't expect the weights to be very different than those calculated for a single season - again, the idea is that baseball doesn't really change much - but they might be different enough that we could think of wOBA calculated with the era weights as a kind of expected wOBA (except not in those terms, exactly, because statcast).

**Results:** I ran the BOCPD algorithm in R with input variables R/PA, OBP, ISO and K%. I only used 1950-present and excluded pitchers as they're just terrible hitters and aren't part of the pool we want to compare position players to. I chose these to represent aspects of offense - overall run scoring, moving the line vs power, and putting the ball in play. Are these the best choices? Maybe, maybe not. I did try other combinations of variables just to see, and the results weren't meaningfully different. The algorithm [identified 1963, 1994, and 2010](https://imgur.com/a/zjDvTB4) as change points.

What that image shows is:
* scaled input variables, scaled for the sake of the algorithm and to be shown on a common scale
* the probability distribution of run lengths at each time point. Red dots are the maximum probability run length at each step.
In both graphs the dashed vertical lines are the identified change points. The first two change points coincide with a year following expansion, which would make sense. The shading above and below the red line in the bottom graph shows that the model puts some weight on possible change points before and after 1963. It is very sure about the change points in 1994 and 2010.

That the two expansion change points alter offense in opposite ways, and that it only picked up on two of the five expansions (not even the double change of expansion and lowering the mound in '69) makes me a little skeptical that this isn't just picking up noise. 

**Linear Weights:** But just in case it's not totally meaningless, I fit linear weights for wOBA for the eras delineated by those change points.

The weights you at Fangraphs, I believe, are park adjusted and already scaled by the wOBA. These weights are scaled and adjusted by, well, nothing.

P.S.
I used retrosheet event files for the linear weights. I got the already parsed csv files for all seasons up to 2019 from jerryword 's [github](https://github.com/jerryword/retrosheet-csv). I've never been great at getting retrosheet data and having those files available me it soooo much quicker. So very much thanks for having those available, Jerry.

"Quick context: I am trying to use my knowledge of baseball sabermetics to get a leg up next year in fantasy baseball. 

Now for pitching I am mainly using Forcasted Run Average to help aid my decision with pitchers. For hitters I am not as sure on what to use. Currently, I plan on mainly using xwOBA for hitters. Now the issues here is  it's well known that xwOBA isn't a predictive stat. It is a descriptive stat that can be used as a predictive stat (as Tom Tango puts it). Now my idea (which I haven't put much thought into) is make leaderboards that would use FRA or SIERA as the formules and make them for hitters. My reasoning is that this has been done before (xwOBA being turned into xERA) so why not do it in reverse because FRA and SIERA have good predictive values towards next years ERA so if you rescaled them to wOBA's scale might it have a better predictive value of next season wOBA then xwOBA. Again haven't thought this out too much but this is just the premise.

Also if you know better stats then xwOBA for fantasy baseball or predicting next seasons wOBA please comment.",Sabermetrics

"Hello community of /r/Sabermetrics

I am trying to replicate a research paper from Christopher A. Parsons ([""Strike Three: Discrimination, Incentives, and Evaluation""](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.4.1410)) to evaluate Umpire biases towards non-white players with recent data. 

I noticed though that their measurement of player ethnicity is flawed because they use birth places to determine who is Hispanic, Asian or African American. Example: ""Players \[...\] are classified as Hispanic if they were born in: Colombia, Cuba Curacao, Cominican Republic \[...\].""  
This to me seems wrong for obvious reasons.

"**About Baseball Analitica**

As I mentioned on my previous posts, my name is Juanito Banca ( Johnny Bench in english ) and I've been working with baseball data for more than 5 years now. Mostly with StatsApi ( previously using XML's, now JSON's ). Almost a year ago I decided to found Beisbol Analitica, a community that between other things is focused on teaching analytics/coding/sabermetrics to people for free.

One of the projects that BA has started working on is a MySQL that contains play by play, pitch by pitch data for MLB, LatAm winter leagues( LBPRC, LBVP, LMP, LIDOM ) and Mexican leagues(LMB). On top of that, the database contains (open source) stored procedures that calculate interesting things such as REM24, Run Value, wOBA, FIP, Win Expectancy, Park Factors and aggregated data(at several levels). This way by having both the data and the code, people can carry out their own analysis and can understand( and most importantly, reproduce ) advance stats.

* WSBC data.
* Caribbean Series data.
* Dominican Summer League data.

When they don't make it, they don't generate a WAR.

"Hello, I've made multiple posts about a stat that I've recently come up with on r/baseball, and some of the commenters recommended I post about it here. I'm open to hearing feedback on if this is something worthwhile or not.

The aim was to create a stat that is simple to use and understand, with some actual merit, and not that complicated of a formula, that described a pitcher's outing as good/bad/inbetween. This is supposed to be a purely descriptive stat - if it turns out to be predictive, great, but that was not the intention. It's intended use is mainly in smaller samples, especially with relief pitchers, as a better descriptor of a player's performance than ERA or W-L records. 

Formula: x = (([sum of wOBA weights from a given season](https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn)\*times that a type of baserunner was given up in an outing)+0.2\*(SB+WP+BK given up))/(innings pitched in an outing).

If x&lt;=1, the outing was good, x&gt;=2, the outing was bad, x in between 1 and 2 means we can't conclude if the outing was good or bad.

I ran the stat for the entirity of the 2021 season, and the results can be seen in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1d3Bi6RFV1Un6-LujPYXaQ5qP9R8bxDbAcH3l-jcjo/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet. If anyone is interested in the expanded version of the spreadsheet with the 21000+ pitching lines analysed, let me know.

I was advised to compare the stat with ERA/FIP/K%, and here are the results: 

||No.|% of outings|IP|ERA|WHIP|K%|FIP|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GG|9837|46%|18180.2|0.64|0.549|29.37|2.03|
|AG|5693|26%|16574|3.72|1.365|22.2|4.25|
|BG|6011|28%|7860.1|13.81|2.885|16.21|9.46|

Personally, I like the disparity between FIP and ERA, as it shows that the stat fairly accurately describes the past, while having no qualms about predicting the future performance. Nonetheless I'd be interested in incoroporating strikeouts into the formula, possibly by making them weigh more than regular outs. The question is how much more, and does that make the stat lose its previous charm?

"Hello everyone! Continually seeing so many creators out there creating All-Time Rankings subjectively based on personal bias, I decided I wanted to attempt to make one for an article but based off a formula. Here’s the very preliminary outline I have thus far:

Obviously, this is far from perfect, and the formula itself is subjective to a degree. But that doesn’t mean it won’t be entertaining.

Notes:
- JAWS is meant to be heavily weighted. I value the work Jay Jaffe has done in this field.
- fWAR ≠ bWAR weight due to the inclusion of bWAR in JAWS. Could be altered.
- Did positional war, but maybe only necessary to split up between hitters and pitchers.
- The monitor is obviously very subjective due to the nature of awards counting, but I believe in a tiny allocation to consider these factors somewhat in the evaluation.",Sabermetrics

"Hello Sabermetric Fans of Reddit!

For the Blog Site that I run, I did an article  regarding the irregularities of OPS. When I was originally writing the article and subject to Tom Tango’s innate teachings, I was trying to preach the flaws of the stat. But after doing some more thorough research, I found that many statisticians concluded that OPS had a higher correlation coefficient than it’s advanced buddy wOBA in runs scored through decently large sample sizes. After searching for a reason and ultimately not finding one for my article, I’m left curious. Why is OPS more predictive of runs scored than the advanced calculation of wOBA?

"A somewhat-sabermetrics related discussion post - in that I’d like to discuss sabermetric concepts in ways we can’t quantify at all from the outside. But I’m curious what this sub’s thoughts are on the importance of “feel” and communication when integrating new technologies, sabermetric concepts, etc into the day to day life of players and coaches. 

I worked in baseball as a “full-time seasonal” employee for four or so years. I suffered tremendous burnout and am a bit resentful now of an industry I once loved. I did find an avenue to stay somewhat involved, but not with a team, and I found it’s been much better. However, I feel like the one common trend I noticed that drove me up a wall in my time with teams - ranging from Low A to the bigs is just how bad teams are at communicating philosophies and technologies to initiate buy-in. And I don’t think that’s talked about nearly enough.

All of us here are stat heads - writing code, spending hours doing research, and communicating findings with like minded people. Obviously, when you’re one affiliate “intern” on the road with 25 baseball players and a coaching staff - you can’t exactly communicate the same way to do your job. I think in my time in baseball, I got very confidant that I did my job well. I have a lot of colleagues that I’m now proud to call friends. I was always asked back, got good reviews, etc. But, I’ve heard nightmare stories about video guys, technology interns, all the way up to front office staff who roved that drove players and coaches crazy, to the point they were more resentful of newer technologies and analytics. And I think the disconnect is the major way teams can differentiate themselves from one another, with most of the league adopting the same tech and office structure. 

For example, one year, we had a software developer rove. And honestly, I don’t hate the idea. I’m a firm believer that all front office staff should spend at least 3 months with a team to understand that side of operations. An office in beautiful LA is quite different than a team bus heading to the middle of Iowa at 3am. To live that life even for a little gives tremendous experience as to how to create useful resources that’ll actually be used on the ground floor. Anyway, he was in IT and made the advance reports we used daily. But we had GLARING issues with our advanced reports (DM me for details if you really want to know, but it was bad). These issues made reports impossible to convey from coach to player because the coach didn’t understand the sheet, and I had to dance around it and say it was an IT issue that I kept bringing to the front office’s attention. When the developer comes into town, he has no idea what the clubhouse culture is. He doesn’t make an effort to know staff, he isn’t communicating in a way everyone can understand, and he tries to defend incorrect data. He’s sitting in the corner of the clubhouse on his laptop. The whole time. We see no changes in these reports all year and by May, a previously open minded coach is over it - and not just those reports, he grows distrustful of all other tech initiatives. Another thing - I’ve always found coaches, barring your extremely traditional thatve been in the league for 60 years, to be open minded to hearing people out. Coaches aren’t dumb. They know understanding this stuff will get them promoted too, so it’s already an opportunity for those upstairs to build that bridge. 

Another season, we’re an affiliate team in a playoff chase. That means a lot to the guys. And that is when the team decides to roll out a new technology with absolutely no mandate on how to use it. We couldn’t even wait until the start of the second half. Two people from the third party company come to the clubhouse, gather the players, and tell them the in depth advanced details about the technology of our new training software. No player cares about that. They care about if this will help them or not and if it’s easy to do. Inherently, the clubhouse culture is one that rejects the “nerds” who come in abruptly, don’t communicate well, and then expect players to use it. Part of this is of course on the players but - Issue A) everyone cares less in a playoff chase and B) they’re only means to try and encourage use of the product was to say “So and so from the Majors uses it!” And don’t get me wrong, the tech is great, but it was dropped in our office that day and not a single person touched it because everyone forgot or thought it was stupid because of how bad the breakdown was. 

This is the stuff to me, that irritates me to no end. We in a community like this don’t have to worry so much about the human element, but I think it’s understated how important it is. Baseball is full of incredibly smart people, but the divide between analytics and players still feels very off. I’ve been with teams where it’s been quite impressive, but mostly it’s been a nightmarish undertaking to clean up a front office’s poor communication so that people I work with on a day to day buy-in to our philosophies and initiatives. 

And for instance, while we see a LOT of praise for a Trevor Bauer or a Kyle Boddy - those people, through my own experience and many others, is not that great. Everyone recognizes their intelligence, contribution to the game, and their right to be confident due to what theyve done  to change the game. But, I think we undermine people skills. There’s being a loner who does their own thing, and there’s being rude, there’s not hearing anyone else out, and there’s scolding a coworker you already pay a horrible wage to because he asked a question that could’ve been Google’d. Respect is the name of the game, and if you’re just going to get mad at someone because they grew up without your resources to understand all of these advanced concepts - you’re not doing the player or coach any service. There’s a difference to me between confidence/being great at what you do, versus being a complete handful and causing players to deepen their negative stigma on innovation. They say a revolution is never quiet - but you can’t rally the troops the way analysts and industry leaders currently do. You’ll get some buy-in, but not nearly enough. And in today’s climate, the advantage is not in bettering players who will already likely be great, it’s developing the late round/undrafted Low A guy who doesn’t have overwhelming stuff but eats innings and has very interesting numbers to where a small pitch design modification may make a world of difference. But that guy needs to trust the system before we talk him into learning a splitter. 

For example, I worked with a Driveline coach two years ago - one of the smartest human beings I’ve met in baseball. But he was universally hated because he always had his foot in his mouth. He was brought in immediately in a role of authority. And he wasn’t a bad guy, but he was tremendously odd. He always communicated info poorly to players, and once you say something wrong to the wrong guy in the clubhouse, it’s over. For pitchers and hitters. There’s confidence and arrogance - and I think the latter is more present than we are aware of. And while we can’t quantify that even by a little, I think it holds baseball back. Again, I’m confident in how I did based on all the relationships I’m proud to have, but I that was always my biggest emphasis - relationships with those on the ground floor. I think that’s worth more than solely being book smart. 

Anyway. I’m of course a bit biased. My philosophy clashed with what I found to be industry standard and felt burnout. And I’ve had bad experiences with people I share core beliefs with (rooted in analytics) because I hated how they’d communicate the message. However, I think the point stands. In an era full of numbers and spreadsheets, I think MLB front offices need to focus on communicating information and initiatives so players feel like they’re more than their spin rate or exit velocity. Personally, I think having 1-2 players at each affiliate (1 Latin, 1 American) should be consulted to be “player coaches” for encouraging these things would be a tremendous help also. Players will trust one another more than someone who comes into town four times a season. But, I think teams rely on 20 somethings who may not have the confidence or people skills to try to translate complex information that the front office also can’t make easier to understand. 

Enough rambling though. It’s just long food for thought in quarantine - and why I believe the concept of communication now is the next way teams can innovate.",Sabermetrics

"I’ve been thinking about this for a while. As a Bostonian growing up and a lifelong Cubs fan (don’t ask), I have a lot of experience following Theo throughout his tenures in Boston and Chicago, and there is no denying he’s a pioneer for modern-day sabermetrics and a key reason why front offices are structured how they are today. One of the best ever to do it. And he’ll have a statue outside of Wrigley. 

But, I’ve recently begun digging a bit into Theo’s work and wanted to get feedback on what others think of Theo now that the Cubs are a bit more removed from their World Series and we have 15-20 years of work to analyze. My absolute basic premise is that Theo can build teams very well through player development, but once he finds that success, he has a hard time retaining it. I believe he once referred to it as “feeding the monster,” giving into higher priced free agent flops and team cores not doing as well as projected over the long haul. 

Again, he has 3 World Series under his belt. By no means am I trying to take away from that. He is the reason I fell in love with baseball. But, we’ve seen so many Jason Heyward’s, Carl Crawford’s, Yu Darvish’s, Edwin Jackson’s etc. Not everyone will nail every acquisition on the head, and his success rate far exceeds others, but is he as capable of building sustainable success as people think? 

And when it comes to drafting, is he as good as people say? The core Cubs roster was predominantly a result of very high draft picks. He’s done well in early rounds where he’s had a high selection. But, as the Cubs began to see MLB success, the Cubs haven’t been able to really rebuild their farm on the level of the Rays or Dodgers. Which leads me to ask,  is he someone who can keep the MLB side competitive while having an ever-flourishing farm system? Or did he benefit from extremely high draft picks to build that Cubs core? 

Again - before anyone comes down on me, for every flop there’s been two great success stories. The Arrieta trade, the Ortiz signing, the Nomar trade. And I haven’t dug explicitly into numbers and performance yet. Quite frankly, we can’t necessarily quantify an individual in the front office anyway - as we don’t fully know how those around him have worked, how ownership has influenced them (asking for big signings, luxury tax, etc). But, I’m curious what this community’s thoughts on Theo are today. Is he in the upper echelon alongside an Andrew Friedman, or is he more so in that second tier, with how he‘s a bit more erratic after finding initial success with teams? 

Apologies if it’s a stupid question, it’s just a quarantine  3am thought I wish I could quantify.",Sabermetrics

"Pythagorean expectation, or pythagorean winning percentage is a good way to find the quality of a team past it’s winning percentage. Its formula involves the team's runs scored and runs allowed, and spits out a winning percentage that more accurately represents a team's talent. If a team’s winning percentage is .500, but their pythagorean expectation is only .480, that says that the team is overachieving, and that they should have won 48% of their games instead of 50%. This is a good formula to measure a team’s performance, but there is a flaw: all runs are ***not*** created equally. A run against Jacob DeGrom is tougher to get and more valuable than a run off newly called up minor leaguer, but they mean the same when put in the pythagorean expectation formula. Alternatively, allowing a run to the Astros is more justifiable and expected than allowing a run to the Orioles. Same deal for unearned runs; the team did not earn them, therefore they should not be put into a formula calculating how good they are, at least for them on offense. On defense, it is their fault that they allowed that error, so it will be kept in the formula.

I’ve been told that front office employees still maintain full salary, but all of the seasonal staff (coaches to clubbies to trainers) to file unemployment. Some teams offer $100 a month compensation and others a bit more through April.

I’ve always been thrown numbers at me from our analysts but have never understood where they came from or the amount of work they had to go through to give me the information I need to succeed. 

I have little coding experience but have taken a python class on codeacademy and the edX course on Sabermetrics 101. What other classes or books can I read to get some basic knowledge before the season starts? I have heard the book Analyzing Baseball Data with R is good",Sabermetrics
"Hey guys,

I was inspired by another post in this community and decided to share a metric that I have created. Basically, I've worked on and off on this metric over the course of several years, sometimes putting it down for several months while things get busy and picking it back up for a couple weeks here and there.

The stat's goal is to find an expected run total of an individual player as well as the expected RBI contribution regardless of the runners on base and where he hits in the lineup, two factors which can skew Run and RBI totals. The math is messy but here it is.

(((0.107288)\*(1B+BB)+(0.248634)\*(2B)+(0.426495)\*(3B)+(HR)\*(0.83792)+((0.248634)-(0.107288))\*(SB)-((0.107288)\*(CS)))/(AB+BB+HBP))\*1000 = Added Run Contribution

(((1B)\*0.25)+(2B\*0.45)+((3B+HR)\*0.612)+((BB+HBP-IBB)\*0.03))/(AB+BB+HBP)\*1000 = Expected RBI's

Independent Offensive Efficiency = ARC + ERBI

All of the coefficients were calculated using a Run Probability Added Matrix to find the added benefit from each particular scenario.

Using full team data, the regression model between IOE and Total Runs yields a higher R squared value then AVG and Runs, OBP and Runs, as well as SLG and Runs, yet it is is lagging slightly behind OPS and Runs. I was wondering if my metric could be improved upon in an attempt to give it a stronger correlation with runs than OPS, and was wondering if you guys had any ideas or thoughts, whether it be from a baseball side or from a calculations of the coefficients side. Thanks all!",Sabermetrics
"OBP is a nice statistic, yet it fails to adequately capture the true productivity of a batter: it is weighted in a manner that implies a single delivers the same value as extra-base hits.

Thus, to remedy this issue the simple adjustment of weighting hits can be implemented into the equation to create the “BGPA”, or “Bases Generated per Plate Appearance”.

The equation is as follows: ((Singles + 2\*Doubles + 3\*Triples + 4\*HomeRuns) + Walks + HBP) / Plate Appearances

This improved performance of this metric over traditional OBP is proved by its increased correlation to runs created (OBP: 0.73, BGPA: 0.84): [https://imgur.com/a/WhVVYX4](https://imgur.com/a/WhVVYX4) .

"I’ve been thinking about FIP as a stat. It’s supposed to be fielding independent, hence the name, but it seems like FIP relies on three categories, BB, Ks and Home Runs.

It seems like there’s an argument to be made that none of these are really fielding independent. A good outfielder can save some home runs now granted, it’s rare, but in the grand scheme of things so are home runs, so a couple of good outfield plays could really inflate a good pitcher’s FIP. 

It also seems like BB and Ks can really be affected by fielding too, because of how catcher framing can affect a pitcher’s other numbers.

Just a quick random question: I'm in the middle of a career change, trying to move into analytical roles that require more technical/coding knowledge. Due to this, I've been looking for potential data projects and I'm amazed by how much data there is in baseball.

I saw a book called ""Analyzing Baseball Data with R"" by Marchi/Albert/Baumer and wanted to know if it's the best source to learn. I already have a basic understanding of R, but need to start applying it and most courses have either fake or very simple data. I would like to know how well the analytical, visualisation, and simulating concepts in this book can apply to the business world.

"I trimmed down all hitting data since 2011 to hitters that had 5+ consecutive seasons with at least 100 PA.

First, I noticed that these group of hitters had the same rate of improvement of their BB% when analyzing by age (0.14% on average), but started at a higher baseline than all other hitters that didn't fall into that group, albeit, only slightly (+0.4%).

Second, I found a trend in the average BB% delta from one year to a next based on performance using these hitters (R\^2=.985), suggesting that all BB% stabilize towards \~8.85%.

But the 3rd and real reason I'm here is that I found an unexpected trend in the standard deviation of the performance based BB% delta that went in an unexpected direction.

The way I'm reading this trend suggests that as players obtain higher BB%, their BB% Delta's become less consistent, suggesting a wider spread of potential outcomes, both in the positive and negative direction. Meanwhile, the lower a player's BB%, the more consistent they are. This seems a little counter-intuitive to me as my hypothesis was that they'd either be about the same, or that players that had more opportunity to grow (lower initial BB%) would experience more dramatic opportunities for growth.

I'm curious if anyone has any alternative interpretations.

&amp;#x200B;

To catch everyone up, in case anyone has forgotten, log5 formula when you are dealing with multiple outcomes is set up as:

odds ratio, OR = (ProbabilyPitcherOutcome \* ProbabliityBatterOutcome)/ProbabilityLeagueOutcome

inverse odds ratio (my term), iOR = ((1-ProbabilityPitcherOutcome)(1-ProbabilityBatterOutcome))/(1-ProbabilityLeagueOutcome)

Probability of a given outcome = OR / (OR + iOR)

So for a given batter/pitcher matchup you can break that down for singles, doubles, triples, homeruns, etc.  ***My question is this: How does one factor in handedness of the pitcher or batter?*** Right now I am using stats for a given batter against all pitchers. Likewise for the given batter I am using stats against all batters.  For the league I am using a plain old league average of all batting events.  

&amp;#x200B;

Should I? Could I? Break this down into more specific matchup types?  For example if its a RHP, should I generate the batter's Probability Slate using only his PA against RHPs? ***Or does using the log5 formula sorta necessitate a more general approach?***",Sabermetrics

"Sorry for the long post, I'm trying to make sure that I understand this stuff and am showing my work to see where I might be off in my understanding, thanks in advance. 

I understand that BBRef's oWAR and dWAR added together do not create the final WAR value, and the same goes for Fangraphs Off/BsR/Def stats. However, I don't fully understand what each of those components actually means individually

Let's look at Edgar Martinez since he's a DH his defensive value should be consistently the negative defensive value of a DH divided by the amount of games he played right? Here's his [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/edgar-martinez/1086/stats?position=3B/DH) page.

So for the 2003 season on Fangraphs he has -9.9 BsR, +22.1 Off, and -15.0 Def combining to create 2.7 fWAR. The value of a win that season was 10.158 so he must have been in total worth (win value)x(fWAR) so 27.43 runs above replacement.

The positional adjustment for his runs should be -15.0 right? I'm assuming his ""base"" defensive value is 0.0 if his adjusted defensive value is -15.0, so the -15.0 runs gets applied to each value before it's shown, is that right? 

So his value in a vacuum would be 5.1 BsR, 37.1 Off, and 0.0 Def, totaling 42.2 runs above replacement, minus the total DH positional adjustment of -15 would bring us right at 27.2 which is close enough to where hidden decimals can be the difference. Is that right? 

If so then what exactly are each of those individual values actually telling us? Each value states that it's supposed to be runs above or below average. So that would mean that a zero in each field would be an ""average"" DH. Applying the same math as above would give -15.0 runs below replacement which just isn't right so there's something I've got messed up, can you tell me where I'm getting that wrong?


Furthermore, I've got a similar but different issue with [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/martied01.shtml) and their oWAR/dWAR values.

For the same season, Edgar is worth 30 Rbat, -3 Rbaser, -3 Rdp, 0 Rfield, and -13Rpos, adding up those values together would give 11 runs, and they list his Runs Above Average as 12, so assuming there's some hidden decimals in those values, that seems to be how they come up with total Runs Above Average. Apply the amount of runs needed for a win and he is worth 1.2 WAA as stated so that makes sense. 

But where I'm getting tripped up is that his bWAR is 3.3, okay makes sense, his oWAR is 3.3, okay sure, and his dWAR is -1.2, which as he plays a purely offensive position that makes sense. So what I get from this is that his dWAR is telling us that in comparison to any replacement he is worth -12 defensive runs, it couldn't be in comparison to only replacement DHs as they have no defensive value so his dWAR value must in comparison to everyone. 

So then his oWAR shows that he's worth about 34 runs more than... what exactly? If his total bWAR is 3.3 and his oWAR is 3.3 that would leave me to believe that his oWAR is only in comparison to other DHs, but then that means that his dWAR would also be in comparison to only other DHs, but then it wouldn't be negative since DHs have no defensive value. What am I missing here? 

**TL;DR: I don't understand what Fangraphs BsR, Off, and Def run values are in comparison to. If a DH is worth 50 Off does that mean he is worth 50 more runs than a replacement DH, any positional replacement, or is it league average? See my post for why none of these three is clicking with me.**

**As for Baseball Reference, I don't understand the same components, for a DH, it appears as if dWAR is comparing the player to any replacement and oWAR is only comparing the player to offensive players of his position, again see my post for details on why and how this is screwing me up, thank you!**",Sabermetrics

"With the shortened season, I suspect the odds of seeing  a .400 hitter is higher but I'm struggling to calculate the odds of this happening. Any ideas for a better approach?

Here is what I calculated using my scant knowledge of statistics, although the result is probably meaningless.

Charlie Blackmon's stats through August 9:
27H / 59AB = 0.4576 in 65PA

To qualify for batting title in a 60 game season:
60G * 3.1PA = 186PA
186PA - 65PA = 121PA remaining

In his career, Blackmon walks, gets hit, or sacrifices in 9.2% of PA. 
121PA - (121 * 0.092) = 110AB remaining

To hit .400:
0.4 * (110AB + 59AB) = 68H
(68H - 27H) / 110AB = 0.3727

Blackmon would have to hit .373 over his next 121PA.

In six full seasons, he has hit .288, .287, .324, .331, .291, and .314 for an average average of .306 with a standard deviation of .020 (calculated in Google Sheets)

.373 - .306 = .067 / .020 = 3.35 z-score
(I'm trying to figure out his odds of hitting .373.)

P = 1 - 0.5 - 0.4996 = 0.0004 or 1 in 2500.

(z-score table: https://www.conversion-uplift.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Z-Score-Table.jpg)

"I'm working with play-by-play data across multiple years and with a couple of different leagues. I intend to store this data in a database. I have a question about how I should organise it.

Should I have one table, say \`play\_by\_play\` which contains \*\*all\*\* the play-by-play information. (With columns identifying the league and year)?

Or should I have multiple tables for each league/year, say \`MLB\_2019\_play\_by\_play\`?

The first way makes the most sense to me, as it seems like a simpler solution for SQL queries. The downside though, would be that the rows for league/year data set are not independent events, they are reliant on each other and there are variables like RE24 which are dependent on the whole data frame. So it seems a bit weird to lump all the seasons and leagues together, although shouldn't be an issue if I'm always filtering by league and year. The other potential drawback is query time.

Or is there an even better way that I'm not considering?",Sabermetrics

HR is worth 5 points, Triple is 4, Double 3, Single 2, BB is 1,SO is -1. Add those together and divide by AB and you get the TrueHit stat.

"Hello everyone, in a couple of books I've been reading (The Shift, and Smart Baseball) the authors use run expectancy matrices to argue using or not using certain calls in baseball (for example the sacrifice bunt). This always bothered me though, because as far as I understand it, the run expectancy matrix used in these examples is static, and is an aggregate from every situation with every player in the league. In practice, this matrix will be fluctuating wildly depending on who is pitching, who is batting, who's in the field, what the count is, etc. It would almost certainly be changing from game to game, inning to inning, and even pitch to pitch. Has there ever been an attempt to produce a real-time, dynamic expectancy matrix, where the probabilities are updated on a pitch by pitch basis?

"Hello r/sabermetrics,

I’m putting together a project dealing with specifically vertical movement of MLB pitches on their flight to home plate. This, I’m looking for a database that has information on the flight path of pitches thrown in MLB games. Obviously, the baseball savant website offers information on total horizontal and vertical movement of pitches, as well as their release point, however, if possible, I’m looking for more specific data about the position of the ball along its path to home plate. I just don’t know if this data even exists or is publicly available. While researching this, I’ve heard a lot about the idea of “scraping” data from the MLB Pitch f/x database but I don’t really know what that means or whether it would even provide me with additional data, that I can’t already get from baseball savant, relevant to what I’m searching for.

Alternatively, I’m looking for websites that display the estimated or actual flight of the pitch, sort of like you see when you watch games through the MLB At Bat app, except from a side view. I know that their is a page under “visuals” on baseball savant where you can see pitch trails for every pitch thrown, but it’s a little difficult to line up the view of the pitch pathway so that you can overlay a graph on top of it, which is what my intention would be. Is there a website other than baseball savant where this data is available?

Thank you very much for any input you can give me.

By the way, if I’ve greatly overestimated the capabilities of technology to track pitch flight or am searching for a database that likely doesn’t exist, I’m sorry, I’m just getting into the world of advanced baseball stats.

Data: 2016 pitch-by-pitch data from Sportradar, Player data from Fangraphs, Run expectancy matrix.  

Approaches: Predict (CART, RF, GBM, OCT, OCT-H) then Optimize (Regress &amp; Compare), Predict and Optimize concurrently (OPT)

Results: Best results with Optimal Prescriptive Trees (OPT). Stealing based on this model projects to increase run expectancies by roughly 200 runs over the course of the season, based on out-of-sample performance. We found that the run expectancies DECREASED for the league as a whole as a result of actual stolen base attempts (overconfidence in base stealing abilities).  Stealing with my model projects an increase in run expectancies, again based on out-of-sample data.  200 runs is a pretty sizable inefficiency, and it is just sitting out there for teams to take advantage of.

The analysis is extremely thorough, so I pretty confident in these results.  Would love to discuss further/answer any questions in this thread.  There must be a demand for a model like this, no?

"I am trying to determine pitcher similarity scores at the pitch level (i.e. on a pitch-by-pitch basis and not comparing full arsenals). Currently, I am doing this by taking relevant columns (for example, velocity, horz/vert movement, etc.) and doing a simple Euclidean distance after normalization. However, I don't necessarily like this approach because I am currently weighting all columns the same in the distance calculation.

I've recently learned about random forests and it seems like that might be a better way of handling this problem. I don't know much about them, but it appears they can offer weights based on the importance of each feature. Could I use this to give me a list of, for example, how similar each pitch type is to Trevor Bauer's FF by adding up all the features multiplied by the weights? I was thinking about using a random forest classifier, and that would give me the closest pitch type to the input, right? Or would a regressor be better for this problem?

"Does anyone know of the best place to scrape player salary data for each season? I’m looking to analyze team spending trends for each position and haven’t found a standout way to get the salary data yet.

Here are the options I’ve looked into so far (including my reasons for not choosing them):

1. Baseball Reference: there are some pretty substantial gaps, such as not having any salary info if a player starts the season in the minor leagues and gets called up mid-season. 

2. Lahman database: only includes player salary data through 2016

3. Spotrac: most of the good stuff requires the premium account. As a matter of principle, I’d like to avoid signing up for it, but I will if I have to.

"I asked for some help on this sub, so I figured I'd share the fruits of my labor.

I did a lot of analysis on season to season delta on BB% based on both a players age and how they performed the season prior. I used all data from 2009 to 2019, and restricted the data to seasons that had at least 100 PA. This was based off the assumption that BB% normalizes at 100 PAs, but further investigation suggested that 120 PAs is a better value. Maybe I'll update my analysis in the future, but I think 100 PAs will be sufficient to start.

I adjusted all hitter data to normalize based on the average BB% overall compared to each seasons individual league wide BB% trends.

I looked at the delta for season prior, 2 seasons prior, 3, 4 and 5 seasons prior, and 1 season prior appeared to have the most normal distribution, so I'm sticking with that data. 1 season prior also had the most data, and I think this may be why the data was more normal than the rest.

Age was extremely consistent, with a strong positive correlation (0.14% gained with every year aged on average). R\^2 was 0.976 and clearly linear.

📷

Standard deviation for age was fairly consistent for all ages at around 2.83%, although when graphing the StDev for all ages, the R\^2 was a disappointing 0.111. This data seemed to be somewhat linear, with a very low positive slope, so I am going to maintain faith the average stdev (2.83%) of the ages is good enough to represent all ages.

📷

I adjusted the data for age, and found that based on the season prior, BB% delta had a very strong negative correlation that trended towards a BB% of 7% regardless of if BB% was above or below 7%. R\^2 was 0.997 and clearly linear.

 📷 

Standard deviation for BB% delta from season prior was more promising than age related stdev. When graphing the standard deviations in relation to the previous seasons BB%, there was a positive correlation with a clearly linear trend and an R\^2 value of 0.919.

 📷 

When I combined this two factors into one prediction model, I compared the predicted values to the actual values and created a histogram from the data using 0.1 sigma increments. I used MAE and RMSLE for 1, 2 and 3 sigma to determine fitness of the model.

My use of MAE and RMSLE was determined from primarily these two sources:

[https://akhilendra.com/evaluation-metrics-regression-mae-mse-rmse-rmsle/](https://akhilendra.com/evaluation-metrics-regression-mae-mse-rmse-rmsle/)

Compared to other models, these error values were consistently lower.

The final model for this projection model of BB% delta is:  Last Season BB%\*(-0.308) + 0.0213 + (Age of Player for this season - 16) \* 0.00141 

The standard deviation for this model is:  Square root ( (Last Season BB% \*0.0667 + 0.0181)\^2 + (2.83%)\^2 )

"I've been playing around with fWAR for a little research lately and I've had a few questions about how they calculate it that I was hoping someone could shed some light on:

In the batting runs portion, why do they use only the conference for RC and PA instead of the entire league? It doesn't throw the numbers off that much, but it seems strange to me that they would choose to do that when WAR is a league wide stat.

For fielding runs they use UZR value for non-catcher. However when you look at their own library they say to be weary of using UZR to determine how well a defender is due to limited innings in some cases. If you want to compare players with differing games played a position, use UZR/150 -- so why not use that in WAR as well?

I might be nitpicking a bit, but I'm also really curious why these decisions were made.",Sabermetrics
"When querying data with [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search), you can search for data on all pitches thrown or seen by either pitchers or batters, respectively.  You can filter these results by setting a metric range for either  ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" or ""Batter - Times Thru"" but I can't figure out what the latter does.

When searching for pitchers, ie Jacob DeGrom, setting ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" &lt;= 1 returns pitches thrown by Jacob DeGrom against the first 9 batters of every game. 

When searching for batters, ie Aaron Judge, I *thought* setting  ""Batter - Times Thru"" &lt;= 1 would return pitches seen by Aaron Judge the first time he faced a given pitcher, but it also returns pitches seen the second time around against some pitchers. Conversely, setting ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" &lt;= 1, *does* return pitches seen by Aaron Judge the first time he faced a given pitcher, so it would seem ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" controls the number of times through the order, regardless of whether searching for pitchers or batters.

Still, setting ""Batter - Times Thru"" did remove some results, but looking at the data it returns, I couldn't figure out what it filters for.",Sabermetrics

"Apologies for flooding this page with questions, but I had another clarification question with regards to some of the math. This one is related to expected wOBA in Chapter 2 of The Book. 

For this chapter they are analyzing player's hot/cold streaks by comparing a player's expected wOBA versus observed wOBA for a certain number of games after a supposed streak. My question is related to how they calculate a player's expected wOBA.

Using the example in the text, to compute the expected wOBA of a group with Barry Bonds, Steve Finley, and A-rod, we do the following. Found on page 59: ""Look up Bonds' wOBA for 2000, 2001, and 2002 combined."" Repeat for Finley and A-rod. ""Finally, we would average all three-players' three-year wOBA weighted by the number of post-streak PA each player has. This number is the expected wOBA for all the players in this particular bucket."" Given they provide the post-streak PA, in the paragraph before as 95, 63, and 89 for Bonds, Finley, and A-rod, this would be the straightforward calculation: (95\*Bonds\_wOBA + 63\*Finley\_wOBA + 89\*Arods\_wOBA)/(95+63+89).

They go on to analyze the 10 hottest streaks in 2003 and they state: Here is a list of the ten players who had the hottest seven-game streak in 2003, along with their three-game post-hot streak wOBA, and their expected (three-year) wOBA. (See Table 16)."" - page 61. My question is how do they calculate the expected wOBA for the individual player. I know it is not a player's three-year wOBA because I have checked and it does not match. For example, take Marcus Giles, the first guy in the table. His expected wOBA after his hot streak was .354. His wOBA from 01-03 was .363 (I used FanGraphs for this). Are they weighting each year's wOBA, by each year's post streak PA in this case?",Sabermetrics

"This is an attempt by me to calculate how valuable a defender is based on inside edge fielding. If you are not familiar with IE Fielding, it divides plays into how likely an average fielder would make that play. There are 6 zones:

&amp;#x200B;

* Routine/Almost Certain: 90-100%+ chance to make
* Likely: 60-90% chance to make
* About Even: 40-60% chance to make
* Unlikely: 10-40% chance to make
* Remote: 1-10% chance to make
* Impossible: 0% chance to make

&amp;#x200B;

Note: these ranges are from the fangraphs post on Inside Edge Fielding ([https://library.fangraphs.com/defense/inside-edge-fielding/](https://library.fangraphs.com/defense/inside-edge-fielding/)). You can see that Routine is not listed, I will get into why I listed Routine as a category later^(\[1\]).

&amp;#x200B;

So while this measures how likely a player is to make all of these plays, there is no cumulative rating for Inside Edge Fielding that I have found. Now, I wanted to make a cumulative rating to use for some analysis of players in Out of the Park Baseball 21, because zone rating just measures how likely a player is to reach a ball and range factor measures the same thing, but with a different method. There is no counting stat that brings into account how often a player makes errors on easy plays in OOTP ^(\[2\]). In order to do this, I use the following formula:

&amp;#x200B;

    (0.01 * BIZ-Rm - (0.99 * (BIZ-R - BIZ-Rm)))
    (0.1 * BIZ-Lm - (0.9 * (BIZ-L - BIZ-Lm)))
    (0.5 * BIZ-Em - (0.5 * (BIZ-E - BIZ-Em)))
    (0.75 * BIZ-Um - (0.25 * (BIZ-U - BIZ-Um)))
    (0.99* BIZ-Zm - (0.01 * (BIZ-Z - BIZ-Zm)))
    (2*BIZ-Im)                                +

&amp;#x200B;

This formula rewards players for making hard plays and punishes players for making errors on easy plays. Not only does this give context behind errors (a player with higher range commits more errors than a low range player because they have more opportunities), but it also punishes lower range players for not making plays an average defender would make.

The weights are fairly arbitrary. For example, the About Even zone has a 50/50 weight, which is in the middle of the range. However, the Likely zone has a weight of .1 for a made play and .9 for an unmade play. I don't know how to determine the proper weights, so I wanted a baseline to start with. I looked at the ranges listed on fangraphs and based it off of those. As I am trying to find a good defender, I want to heavily punish players for not making easier plays, while also rewarding them for making almost impossible plays. At the same time, I don't want to reward players too much for making easy plays and not punish them for missing the harder plays. Almost Certain and Remote are based on the top end (assuming there is no play that is 100%) and bottom end of the zone, 99% and 1%. For Likely, I used the 90% because, again, I want to punish players for making errors on simple plays. For unlikely, because it has such a large range I went with the mid point of 25%. While I think most players should make a lot of 40% plays, I also don't want to punish them too much for missing a 10% play.

Impossible has a straight add 2 without any kind of penalty. Again, you want to reward players for making those nigh impossible plays, and you don't want to punish them for not making a play they didn't have a chance at. The Hardball Times ([https://tht.fangraphs.com/digging-deep-into-inside-edges-fielding-data/](https://tht.fangraphs.com/digging-deep-into-inside-edges-fielding-data/)) pointed out that outfielders will have some plays that are impossible, like gappers that a player has no chance to make cause or ones that fall in just over the infielder's heads, but falls into a zone manned by the outfielder for Inside Edge.

Now, a certain number of people, hopefully most of you, are saying ""But why are you using your bias to weight the plays? That will make the information less reliable!"" I agree. However, I am bad at math and could not determine a better way to determine the proper weighting. And if I just waited until I had perfect or even really solid weighting I would never have started. If anyone has any suggestions on how I could make the formula better I am open to ideas. I'm not married to any of the weights.

Now, because OOTP is a foreign concept to a lot of people, and I assume some people here who play OOTP don't get into Perfect Team much, let's take a look at 2 players to see how the metric works. I'm going to look at the 2019 season for Adalberto Mondesi and Andrelton Simmons^(\[3\]). Both are shortstops. Simmons is considered one of the best shortstops of all time, is certainly the best active shortstop and deserves to at least be in the conversation with players like Ozzie Smith and Omar Vizquel.

Mondesi is definitely a good shortstop, but he is not on the same level as Simmons. Looking at his UZR metrics, he had a double play rating of 1.3, range rating of 3.7 and error rating of 4.1. This was good enough for a UZR/150 of 11.7 - certainly adding value definsively. Part of that is driven by his OOZ - he made plays on 57 plays outside of his zone, about once every other game (he spent a good chunk of the season on the IL and only played 102 games).

BIZ-CR:

* Andrelton Simmons: 17.65
* Adalberto Mondesi: -7.41^(\[4\])

Now there's a couple of things to consider before we continue. The first thing is that you cannot compare across positions. As Inside Edge is based on how an average fielder at the position would field the play, comparing a center fielder to a first baseman is not a good comparison. Another reason you can't compare across positions is due to the second thing to consider: more opportunities equals a higher cumulative rating. This rating is not normalized, although you could normalize it to 150 games in the same manner UZR is normalized.

However, this is an apt comparison. Both players are short stops, and Simmons played 103 games, one more than Mondesi. You can see that Simmons is a much better shortstop than Mondesi. The biggest difference between the two players is the ability for Simmons to convert the unlikely and remote plays. 

For more insight on this, it is helpful to look at Mondesi's 2018 UZR metrics. His range rating was 6.1, which is certainly well above average and comparable to Simmons in 2019. However, in 2018 Mondesi had a -2.1 double play rating and -0.6 error rating. Mondesi is very good at reaching balls with his 80 grade speed. However, outside of the range he is probably an average shortstop.

Why is this number valuable over something like DRS or UZR? The main difference is that these statistics take the run value of the ball into account, while Inside Edge information is run-neutral. As fangraphs states, ""Some fielders are good at making the easy plays but don't have range. Some players have tremendous range but fail to execute easy plays. Inside Edge lets you track that more easily than the high level stats which only show you run values.""

In the scenario I am in, I care about how a player performs on every play, not just plays with higher run values. I care about a diving grab in the outfield with no one on in the first as much as I do when the bases are loaded in the ninth. We all know there is no one metric that is perfect for measuring a player's performance. This is another tool I devised to help me measure something I didn't have a great way to measure. I want to put a player out there who, on average, is going to make the most plays.

**TL;DR: I took the plays made and not made according to inside edge and combined it into 1 number that attempts to show how good a player is at making plays.**

&amp;#x200B;

\[1\] The Certain/Almost certain field in OOTP is referred to as Routine. It uses R for routine plays and Z for remote plays.

\[2\] I need counting stats because I need to combine various simulations with the same player under 1 player. In tournaments, players get 4-35 games to perform. That is not enough to get a large sample size. However, simulating a bunch of tournaments and combining all copies of the player to develop a larger sample gives a much more accurate depiction of a player's performance.

\[3\] Fangraphs does not have IE Fielding for 2020, but it does have other defensive metrics. Fangraphs also does not provide the opportunities and made plays, just a percentage and a number. I could not determine whether that was the opportunities or made plays, so I am working as though that's the made plays. For one it makes more sense to me to display the number of plays made than opportunities. If I am wrong, while the actual numbers will change, the values will have a similar spread.

\[4\] Most players in my experience have ratings below 0. I think players are punished too hard for not making plays, but I am not sure how to adjust it. This is a great example of how the formula is far from perfect, or even complete.",Sabermetrics

As of today we are processing data for 5  Latin America, leagues ( LBPRC, LBVP, LMP, LMB, LIDOM ) and we are calculating a bunch of interesting stuff based on StatsApi data: REM24, wOBA, Win Expectancy, as well as other metrics. All the data we compute is stored in a MySQL database and the code is shared  publicly on GitHub([https://github.com/andres-alvarado/beisbol-analitica](https://github.com/andres-alvarado/beisbol-analitica)). It also contains play by play, pitch by pitch data, etc.

I found that the average strike/ball ratio is **slightly lower when the shift is on**, and the difference is statistically significant, but does this make sense? Intuitively, my explanation is that teams pitch batters to roll over into the shift, so pitchers try harder to hit their spots instead of just throwing strikes.

"In this article, we motivate the SEAM (synthetic estimated average matchup) method for describing batter versus pitcher matchups, both numerically and visually. We provide a [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com) that is available at

[https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/app/](https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/app/).

This app allows users to visualize synthetic spray chart distributions (batted-ball distributions) for any batter-pitcher matchup that has occurred or could have occurred in the last five years, the years that [Statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) data exists. These synthetic spray charts are visualized over an image of a representative baseball field so that the batted ball distribution is displayed to give proper context. Our app also reports performance metrics that are calculated directly from the displayed synthetic spray chart distribution. The expected number of singles, doubles, triples, home runs are reported. The expected batting average on balls in play (xBABIP) and the expected bases on contact (xBsCON) are also reported. These matchup dependent metrics allow for any user to assess the expected performance of batters and pitchers when they face each other.

The SEAM method is based on estimating a spray chart distribution that describes the distribution of batted balls produced when a particular batter faces a particular pitcher. Informally, these spray chart distributions are 2-dimensional contours that overlay spray charts. We construct these spray chart distributions for batter-pitcher matchups where separate batter spray chart distributions are constructed for each of the pitches that the pitcher throws. Rich pitch characteristic information is used to supplement labelled pitch type data since the velocity, trajectory, movement characteristics, and release points of a pitch exhibit large variation across pitchers. The reported spray chart distribution for the batter pitcher matchup is the aggregation of the spray chart distributions for each pitch that the pitcher throws. The aggregation is with respect to the percentage that the pitcher throws each pitch.

One concern with this approach is the potential sparsity of batter-pitcher matchup data. We alleviate this concern with the development of synthetic batters and pitchers with similar characteristics as the batter and pitcher under study. Our synthetic player creation methodology is inspired by the notion of similarity scores like those motivating [PECOTA](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/pecota-projections/) and [Bill James's work](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/similarity.shtml). However, unlike the similarity scores presented in the past, we construct similarity scores using a nearest neighbor approach that is based on the underlying batter and pitcher characteristics of the players under study instead of observed statistics. For pitcher comparisons, pitchers are aggregated on a season and pitch type basis. The variables considered are: velocity, spin rate, horizontal break, horizontal release angle, horizontal release point, vertical break, vertical release angle, vertical release point, and extension. Averages of these variables are taken across each pitcher-pitch type combination. To be eligible for comparison, a pitcher must share at least \[n\_{pitch types}/2\] pitches with the pitcher under study, where n\_{pitch types} is the number of pitch types thrown by the pitcher under study, and \[\] is the [ceiling function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions). For batter comparisons, batters are aggregated on a season, handedness, and pitch type basis. The variables considered are: exit velocity, launch angle, pull%, middle%, and oppo%. Averages of these variables are taken across each batter-pitch type combination. These player characteristics are obtained from Statcast and is scraped using functionality in the [baseballr](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) R package. These characteristics reflect the underlying talent and tendencies of players.

For each batter-pitcher matchup we estimate three spray chart densities, the first is the natural spray chart density corresponding to the players under study, the second is the spray chart of the synthetic pitcher versus the original batter, and the third is the spray chart of the original pitcher versus the synthetic batter. We report a synthetic spray chart density which is a weighted average of these spray chart densities. The weights are chosen with the aim of minimizing estimation uncertainty in the form of [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error).

I'm interested in looking at how pitching stats change in relation to how many times they have faced the lineup. For example, how ERA or OBA changes from the first time through the lineup, to the second time and etc.. 

I have data for each batting event outcome by pitcher (hit, out, walk, etc.) pulled from statcast, so it includes variables such as game date/ID and opponent. 

I am only interested in collecting league-wide/aggregate data, so no need to partition by team or player (although I may wish to do this eventually.)

My thought process (to find OBA for example) is to do something like, for each game:

* Track each pitcher tracking how many batters they face. 
* For the first 9 batters, compute the # of hits and at-bats, and add them to separate total counters that will track the first time through the order. 
* Repeat the same process for the 10-18th, 19th-27th batters faced, keeping respective total counters.
* Then use the total aggregated values to calculate the average OBA for each group. 

This seems rather convoluted, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a better method to make this kind of calculation that I could read up on.

When determining JAWS they use a player's 7 best seasons, but some players don't pitch effectively for 7 seasons (ex. Matt Harvey who only pitched for 3 good years and struggled mightily since or Sonny Gray who's been good one year, bad the next, but good the year after)

"Hey folks. I hang out on /r/Sabermetrics a lot and try to help people out ad-hoc, I think this is a generally a really good community with some good folks hanging out in it.

That's why I find it frustrating to see people trying to take advantage of this community by advertising scammy writing positions where they undercut you and your work. While I am currently in a different line of work, I was a professional baseball analytics writer for several years, contributing to a variety of reputable outlets as a freelancer including The Athletic. I have also written for scummy, scammy outlets who underpaid me for my work (if I got paid at all) and would do stuff like delete my portfolio when I left. I have a good amount of experience with the good and bad sides of the industry, and I wanted to share — based on my experience — what you should look for in a legitimate analytics writing position and what you should avoid, to help people know what is worth their time.

If you're interested in writing for any other position — not just analytics — I think these rules may apply too. Sports analytics aren't the only field with these issues.

Here are what you should look for in analytics writing positions:

# 1. Fair Payment

## What to avoid

I cannot stress enough how important it is that you ensure that you get paid. I have seen a variety of positions thrown up on this and other subreddits offering the following as compensation for writing or social media work:

* Experience
* Exposure
* A resume builder
* Access to professional editors
* A percentage share of advertising revenues
* Unconventional payment structures

All of these have sincere issues as far as compensation, and they are red flags that you should look elsewhere. I will explain why.

### Experience:

When someone offers you the ability to write articles ""for experience"", they are usually, at best, only offering you a prompt for your articles *and nothing else*. The experience of writing for someone else's website is little different than if you were writing for yourself on your own personal blog. The only difference is that you are offering up your labor for someone else to make money off of. Your experience writing for another website is just as valuable as blogging for yourself, and down the road, people will treat those experiences almost identically.

I will also note that if you work is good enough to appear on a website, it is good enough for you to be paid for it, regardless of how many weeks, months, or years you have spent writing. When you write an article for a website, you are a businessman selling your product, and you are a bad businessman if you are giving away your product for free.

### Exposure

When someone offers you exposure instead of money to write for them, it is important to know that their exposure is effectively worthless. A good rule of thumb is this: if a website does not generate enough clicks to pay you, then it does not generate enough exposure to make it worth your while. When a website claims the former, the latter follows, unless the owners of the website are bizarrely hellbent on sponging up all the revenue for themselves.

Exposure is something you can generate on your own. You will generate 10x more exposure by frequently pitching yourself to legitimate websites, networking, and promoting your own blog than by simply writing for a content mill. You do not need someone to give it to you, you can go out and get it yourself.

### A resume builder

Again, this is something you can do on your own. Writing samples are everything, but whether or not your samples are hosted on your own website or on another are inconsequential. In general, if a website is reputable enough to boost your resume, it is reputable enough to pay you fairly. 

### Access to professional editors

There is something truly strange about a website that prioritizes editors over writers, who are ultimately responsible for the words that get printed on the site. This is not to speak down to the position of editor (having been an editor myself and having worked for several great, talented editors), rather it is to say that such a perk is often talked up much more than it is. If you are concerned about having an editor, I would suggest you work on your own editorial skills working on your own pieces. These will come in handy down the line and help your personal development.

### A percentage of advertising revenues

This is something of a gray area. I have worked for a site that offered a rate of $5 for every 1,000 clicks my article got, but this was on top of a $45 base payment per article and they were very transparent about the performance of my work. I have also worked for a site that offered me $1 for every 1,000 clicks, with no base pay — which turned out to be just a few cents after I discovered how poorly the website actually performed in terms of clicks.

This might be a case by case basis, and I would advise that if someone offers you a position with this as your primary means of compensation, to ask them how well an average article performs in terms of total earnings. If they tell you what the most was they ever made for an article, press on them and ask them for the average figure. Then, it's up to you — but I highly recommend positions that offer a base rate per article or per word.

### Unconventional Payment Structures

I have seen some sites offer some truly unusual forms of compensation and, at times, even have the audacity to ask the *writers to pay the website for the privilege of publishing the article*. Unless you work for a PR agency, this is not the norm. Convoluted structures such as ""you write for us for free for three months and then we start paying you a percentage of ad revenue"" are almost certain to leave you underpaid.

## What to look for

In general, as a freelancer, you should be looking for positions that offer a fair amount for the writing you do. How much your time is worth might be up to you, but in general, when I was first starting out, I considered about 1 hour of work to be worth about $8 (approximately the federal minimum wage), and I tended to avoid opportunities that offered less than $10 per article — because it would generally take me longer than an hour to write a 600-800 word piece. The pay scales may vary from outlet to outlet, but in general, you should think long and hard about how much work a website asks you to do versus how much they pay you for.

If you find yourself unable to find a website that will pay fairly for your work, two things:

* *Keep trying*. Keep pitching yourself, keep in contact with editors, network, etc. One of the first places I got paid fairly for, it took me several tries before one of my pitches got accepted. Keep pitching — it's good practice for future pitches, and it shows the type of persistence that will make editors want to bring you on or contact you for articles in the future.

* *In the meantime, write for yourself*. When you have a good article idea and you can't pitch it anywhere, write it yourself and post it on a blog. At a bare minimum, you have a sample you can be proud of and submit to other websites. Don't let someone else take your article and publish it for you for free — like I said, you're a businessman, and it's bad business to give away your product for free.

The holy grail of analytics writing is a full-time writing position (hard to come by in our current COVID-19 economy). If by some miracle you chance upon something like this — something I was never able to, hence the career change — then remember to value yourself fairly (though it's a lot more difficult for outlets to skirt underpayment laws with positions like these, so you are almost certainly fine — pat yourself on the back, you made it!).

# 2. Outlet Size and Culture

## What to avoid

In general, the idea of what constitutes a ""reputable"" outlet is up to your discretion. However, there are several red flags you can look out for in terms of outlets to avoid, avoiding them because they might scam you, steal your work, or are not worth your time.

* *The outlet has a very small social media presence and is run by people you're not familiar with.* In general, if there's very little history on an outlet and it doesn't seem to have a large social media presence, unless it has some fairly prominent name backing it, it might not be 100% legitimate.

* *The outlet has a poor reputation*. Websites affiliated with a particular brand named after a chair you might find at a pub plus the word sports do not have a great reputation in terms of editorial content, let alone the way they represent themselves to the general public, and they're not alone. Do some background work on the people who run the website, the people who write for the website, and the quality of the work they churn out. It will never hurt you to do some research — then again, I probably don't have to tell /r/Sabermetrics that.

* *The outlet frequently engages in spam practices to share their articles*. One of the scummy places I worked for had a practice of writing articles, then submitting their article to every single reddit community where it could be applicable. This strategy is fairly common but also highly volatile — their domain was shadowbanned from reddit and what little revenue they got from spam vanished overnight. If an outlet cannot rely on organic engagement to share their pieces and generate revenue, then their revenue streams — and your means of getting paid — are shaky at best.

All of this advice is, obviously, on a case-by-case basis. I advise you to exercise your best judgement when it comes to evaluating outlets. But in general, you should think — do I want to write here and work with these people?

## What to look for

When I was looking for places to write for, a couple things stood out to me as positives, and I recommend you look for them too.

* *Direct and up-front communication*. Of all of the places I worked for that I had the best experience with, all of them were very direct and up front — about what types of pitches they were looking for, how frequently  they were looking for pitches, and how much I would be paid. If a place isn't afraid to shy away from their practices, you can have some degree of confidence that they're follow through on them.
* *Affiliated with reputable outlets or writers*. Thanks to public pressure, it has been far more difficult for outlets like Sports Illustrated and SBNation to offer [pennies on the dollar or less to writers](https://web.archive.org/web/20200611052423/https://deadspin.com/how-sb-nation-profits-off-an-army-of-exploited-workers-1797653841). Blogs affiliated with larger, national outlets can be a double edged sword, but you can usually find out good information about working for these places by virtue of their prominence. You can also feel more confident if a website already has other prominent writers working for it, or people that you know and trust.
* *Solid social media presence*. This can be subverted with fake accounts or astroturfed networks — I worked for a place that created hundreds of twitter accounts to promote the content we created for each team the content was relevant to and had them all follow each other so they looked more popular than the other — but if there is consistent, organic social media engagement with a website's posts, that's a good sign that they're legitimate. If a website has *no* social media presence, run the opposite direction.

# 3. Application Process

A lot of what I have told you to look out for will pop up during the application process, either organically or you can ask questions about it. There are some other important things you should look out for with regards to applying to work for websites.

## What to avoid

* A common scam for disreputable sites is to ask writers to write an article as a part of the application process on a topic given by the hiring editor. When the article is finished and submitted, the writer is ghosted and the editor posts the piece under their or another name on their site, getting free labor. Reputable websites should be and will be happy to evaluate you on the basis of your samples, not on a contrived writing exercise.

* Asking you to do arbitrary behind the scenes things, like recruiting writers for the website or editing other pieces for free. I will caution you to exercise your best judgement, but in general, if you are going to do something for a website, you shouldn't do it for free. Remember, you're a businessman!

# Bonus — How to Pitch Yourself

Understanding that with the sports world at a standstill, getting paid to write about sports is even more challenging than it is right now, I want to really quickly guide you through the process of getting paid, either as a freelancer or contributor, to write analytics articles for outlets.

Before pitching yourself, I would recommend making sure you have the following:

* *A portfolio of 8-10 published pieces*. These can be all of the articles you have ever written or they can be a handful out of hundreds. Point being that these articles should represent your best work. Ideally, your articles will span the topics you feel comfortable writing about and showcase a variety of tone and analytical techniques. You should edit them as you see fit to make the best impression. If you have previously written for multiple outlets, you may be inclined to show off the variety of outlets you've written for in the past in your portfolio, but my advice is to prioritize the quality of your writing over demonstrating a variety of outlets — it's also fine if every single piece is from your personal blog. I have personally used https://www.journoportfolio.com/ in the past but other services are out there as well.

* At least three good pitches. A pitch is a short, ~100 word blurb about an article that you want to write. Succinctly, it will explain what the idea of the article is and why it's important. I think it's always a good idea to have at least three at any given time — when I was offered a contributor position, that was how many they asked me for.

* If you're applying for an advertised contributor or full-time position, I would have a resume and references prepared as well.

If someone advertises a contributor or full-time position, then apply via whichever method they ask — usually an online form or through email. If applying via email, be sure to include a link to your portfolio, even if they don't explicitly ask for it — they want to see it and will ask for it eventually if they don't upfront.

If someone is actively looking for pitches, then send them an email. Briefly introduce yourself, link to your portfolio and then pitch them on an article that you want to write. Be polite, formal, and make sure to say something like ""Let me know if you'd be interested in something like this."" at the end of the email.

If you are emailing someone who isn't explicitly looking for pitches, send them a quick introductory email and ask if they are accepting pitches while expressing your interest in writing for their outlet. Feel free to say something like ""I have an idea for an article that I think would be a good fit for this site and was hoping to run it by you"". If they follow up, send them a pitch email like I described above.

Above all, be courteous and professional. Keep in mind that if you pitch an article to an outlet and they ask for the article but do not want to pay for it, you can always politely walk away and pitch it elsewhere.

#Conclusion/tl;dr

I understand that the above is a sheer wall of text, so if you don't feel like reading the entire thing, here are a few quick takeaways for you.

* If a website asks you to write for free, you are giving them free labor at little benefit to yourself. You undercut the value of your own labor and the labor of others by writing for someone else for free. In these circumstances, it is universally better to write for yourself on your own blog instead, and I highly recommend and encourage it.

* If you want to write for an outlet, make sure that you do a little research beforehand. If you really want to know what writing for an outlet is like, email some current or former writers — especially former writers, who will feel less of an obligation to shy away from what might be bad about writing there. You'll get honest opinions.

* Get clear, up-front communication from your editors. You'll both be happy.

I’m currently a sophomore in college who has gotten the opportunity to work as a undergrad data analyst for a baseball sports analytics group on campus. The group works with the university baseball team to do two main tasks:

- use the teams data services to create scouting reports for upcoming matchups

- use the baseballr package to scrape pitch data from NCAA.com

- an independent project that could be useful for the team (I’d have to run it by the professors and manager)

Pretty much I know nothing about baseball, all the other sports analytics projects I did were about basketball and football. I used a lot of machine learning methods in those projects. I would like to do an independent project with some applications of supervised machine learning to baseball, but due to my lack of domain knowledge I don’t know what is even useful to  managers/teams. 

If anyone here who is an avid baseball fan, could someone give me some examples of metrics/situations that could be useful if there was a way to use historical data for predictive analytics? If you were a manager where would you want to see analytics used or machine learning to extract insights/predict outcomes? I’m open to ideas/suggestions

"Hi everyone,

I've been developing a machine learning based pitch evaluation technique, the details of which can be found in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jm9v3m/pitchingbot_using_machine_learning_to_understand/)

The idea is to predict the value of a pitch by only using its characteristics and contextual information, with no specific information on who the pitcher and the batter are.

I've been updating this model and it now can produce probabilities for specific outcomes, as well as a run value for each pitch.

Here are some tools to explore the results which could be of interest to some and I'd be grateful for any feedback

* [Create-your-own-pitch](https://mlpitchquality.shinyapps.io/pitch_tester/): Want to know the expected results for a Gerrit Cole fastball at the top of the zone? The swinging strike rate of a Jacob deGrom slider on the outside corner in an 0-2 count? The results for any pitch in any situation thrown over any part of the plate? You can do that in this web app.

* [Batter Perfomance](https://mlpitchquality.shinyapps.io/batter_app/): By comparing actual results to expected results from the model, we can look at batter performance while controlling for pitching quality on an individual pitch basis.

* [Pitcher Grades](https://mlpitchquality.shinyapps.io/pitcher_app/) I like to think of my model as a robot scout, I've grouped its results and converted them to the 20-80 scouting scale. Here you can see how pitchers were graded based on the quality of their pitches in the 2020 season.

"Specifically, I'm trying to understand Cody Bellinger's 2019. His Fangraphs page is [here](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/cody-bellinger/15998/stats?position=1B/OF) for reference. His 2019 ""Def"" is 3.4.

I know that Fangraphs uses UZR in their calculations so here is how I *think* that his ""Def"" would be calculated. He played 3 positions so it should be the sum of his UZR at each position with each position's defensive adjustment (prorated for the amount of time he played at each position). 

Per Fangraphs, a full season is 1,214 defensive innings. So I took the following to calculate his Def, but came up with a total Def of 2.2 instead of 3.4 as expected, can anyone tell me what I'm missing when trying to calculate this value? Thanks:

"So I know most batters will take a 3-0 pitch. I've been wondering what happens in at bats when the count then goes 3-1. My hunch is that batters are just as likely to swing 3-1 (after going 3-0)  as they are in any other count. My hypothesis is that batters would be better off taking a 3-1 pitch if they took the 3-0 pitch. The idea being that the 3-0 pitch is probably the only meatball they're going to see and if they took that pitch, they should wait for a full count or try to take a walk.

"I have invested a great deal of time into creating SSIS packages that process all of the GameDay XML data. I fear that it will be going away next year. As I understand it, MLB is requiring sportsbooks to use official datasources and MLB has partnered with SportsRadar to be the (only?) provider of data to the sportsbooks (and media companies).

This can be good in some ways as MLBAM does not have in their mission to support the ETL needs of publishers, broadcasters, and sportsbooks, let alone individual consumers of the data.

However, I have tried to contact, so far, two feeds providers and neither is very enthusiastic in dealing with a small, paying customer. I tried SportsRadar and Don Best so far.

Does anyone have any insight into this changing landscape? 

* PitchFX is being replaced by the newer, better Statcast.
* MLB agreement with PitchFX ""owner"" SportsMEDIA Technology Corp (SMT) expires 12/31/2019.
* PitchFX data has remained in freely obtainable XML feeds.
* MLBAM made Statcast data available via API to the public temporarily
* The MLBAM API is now locked down.

My personal opinion is that this might be a good time to build some scrapers to collect the data. Unfortunately, that's a very turbulent form of data collection, and it would require a lot of redundancy so that when one website (data source) changes their site, you have another scraper still working.

It can be hard enough to react to small changes in a clean data source over time, but having to do things like this will make it infinitely more labor intensive. I'd gladly pay for the data, but the official providers don't want small customers.

This season I offered the captain of my Last Man Stands (LMS) T20 cricket league side some statistical analysis to influence player selections and predict/improve our results.

Our Team is very much in an amateur league but we all take it very seriously and play to win. We have a squad of about 15 players (depending on availability vying for 8 spots each match).

The Team has previously been ranked in top 25 in the world (there are over 5,000 teams globally) and played in the national championships.

Last season wasn't our best and our ranking slipped back to almost 300 in the world.

In our first two matches I successfully predicted the results (1 win, 1 loss) and whether we would obtain a bonus point or not. Based on team rankings, Head to Head results and overall win percentage.

While I currently do this for my own enjoyment and the good of our team, I wonder if their might be a business/career opportunity doing this. LMS records a wealth of data and its easy to export and manipulate for any team.

Attached is a quadrant analysis of our batsmen (X axis = average, Y = strike rate, size = number of innings). I am point ""D"". I have done similar analysis for our bowling and all rounders.

Returning to the project this season but a few things have changed. Up until last year all data such as horizontal and vertical break, spin rate, location, pitch type, outcome, etc. where all easily available in xml. This year, it seems that specifically spin rate and axis are completely gone.

"Hi.  This is my first time posting here in Sabremetrics -- I only just realized that I perhaps will find a more intelligent and productive interactions on here versus on /r/DFSports.   Allow me to explain the project i've been working on for most of the season.

&amp;#x200B;

With the goal in mind of making some money by applying math and statistics to daily fantasy baseball, I initially attempted to use machine learning techniques to try predict player's fantasy performance.  After a month or two of this, I threw my hands up in the air and decided to scrap the project.  This is when I happened to meander onto some Sabremetrics blogs, and I heard about using Markov chains to simulate baseball.  Using this along with Bill James' Log5 equation, I ended up creating a pretty damn functional markov-chain based simulator that pulls player data to simulate each day's slate.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically for a given slate of games, I tell my code to generate between 1-2 million lineups, then whittle those down to just those that satisfy the salary requirement for lineups on the DFS site, then I run between 2000-10000 simulations of the slate of games.  After each simulation it calculates how many fantasy points each lineup would have produced, and keep a record tally to look back on later.  Using this, I make (mostly) good wagers on Daily Fantasy Sports sites.

&amp;#x200B;

So why am I posting this?  Well, as we all know, the season is rapidly coming to a close (regular season, at least), and so I am pondering what to do in the off-season while I wait April to come.  I've been thinking: there are a ton of questions I have, and ideas I think might make my codebase work better.  Honestly though, what I really need is someone to bounce ideas off of -- or even to critique my process, to give me a better idea of which way to go.  Ideally I was thinking, someone with a background in Sabremetrics would be preferable to someone with a background in Daily Fantasy Sports, though if anyone out there is both and would care to spend time shootin the shit with me, please let me know.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone who would be interested in helping me out?  Or even, come next year, partnering with me to bring a fresh set of eyes to the codebase?  For the partnership thing, you would need to be familiar with Python.  For anyone who is curious or cares to answer some of my more specific math/sabremetrics/baseball philosophical questions, either msg me or answer here.  

&amp;#x200B;

In order to not have this post immediately go dead, let me fire off two example questions i've been trying to figure out:

&amp;#x200B;

1) My attempt to implement park factors into my code seems to have caused a large overinflation of runs scored for various games.  What I did was take the log5 equation and calculated it as (POhitter x PObatter)/POpark, where the PO = Probability/(1-Probability).  What I used for the Probability park factors was to take as much data from 2010 - present for each ballpark, split into four categories:  Left handed hitters @ home,  right handed hitters @ home, left handed hitters @ road, right handed hitters @ road.  

Was this not a good route to go?  Most parks each category would have &gt; 10000 PA worth of data, but some of the newest or recently changed parks it only was \~3000-5000 PA.  Do these splits even make sense, given that those road PA are likely heavily represented by a team's four divisional opponents (meaning for home games against non-divisional opponents, the probability slates may be bad representations?) . 

If this isn't a good way to do it, what kinda approach would you take?

&amp;#x200B;

2) I keep changing the numbers/logic system that tells the code when to stop using the starting pitcher's probability slate, and switch over to the team's collective bullpen probability slate.  If you were to describe a situation to a computer as to when to predict starting pitchers would get pulled (in terms of total runs, runs that inning, bases occupied/outs situation, whatever you want), what set of rules would you use?

"So if a player goes 5/10 over some stretch, that's pretty good, amounting to a 0.500 batting average. But in a sense, it's not really that impressive. It's such a small sample size, that it's basically meaningless.

On the other hand, if someone goes, say, 200/600 over a season, that would be even more impressive in my book. It corresponds to a lower batting average, sure, but that 0.333 average over 600 at-bats is just better.

"Hey, this is my first post on this sabermetics subreddits. I am so interested in sabermetics, but do not have friends to think about it together. Here I present the topic I am obssessed recently and want to discuss together. 

FIP could be one of most famous pitching stats in 10 years. So intuitive and not too hard to calculate. 

FIP formula has a constant term about 3.2 (varying up to the league ERA).

If I remember correctly, the constant comes from the bip and was suggested to be a fixed number because our understanding to batted ball was still unclear. 

Statcast now provides many good informations of the batted balls. Thus, we would want to really fielding independent pitching stats finally by using xwOBAcon or some other statcast stats else. I used xwOBAcon and rescaled the constant term to league ERA. You can see the formula at a python file in the Github repo. I temporarily named it nFIP in my project files. 

HR is also dependent on the environments such as the stadium, weathers, so we want to use barrels instead of HR as the represtative of the well-crushed hit. I named it xnFIP in my project files. 

I also want to discuss if rescaling FIP to ERA makes sense. Why not RA? I want to call it rFIP here, and made derivatives too.

I opened [the Github repo](https://github.com/physhik/baseball_lab
) for this project and uploaed Python files, ipython notebooks for practice.

"I have recently [published a paper](https://chance.amstat.org/2020/02/nostalgia-metrics/) which finds that popular opinion, media opinion, and baseball statistics (WAR in particular) have all over represented the greatness of baseball players who started their career before baseball was integrated.

The core argument is simple: There are too few eligible MLB players who started their career before baseball was integrated to support the abundance of so many of these players in greatest all-time lists. This finding holds even when increases to interest in other sports are taken into account.

I have also made an app that allows for you the analysts to play around with the eligible MLB populations, [here it is](https://deck13.shinyapps.io/challenging_baseball_nostalgia/). Note that the default choices for the slider bars are meant to be conservative. Some rationale for the default choices come from Gallup polling data, changing salaries, changing media exposure, and many articles about baseball interest abroad. I recommend doing some research before going nuts with the sliders, but you are of course free to do whatever you want.

Shortcomings and discussion points: 1) I did not account for the effect that wars, salary, and media exposure have on pursuing a career in the MLB. I conjecture that a proper account of such effects would strengthen the conclusions of the original analysis, but I cannot say that with certainty. 2) This analysis does not have the ability to definitively say which old time players are overrated and which are true all-time era-invariant great players. 3) Ted Williams and Stan Musial played well after baseball was integrated. That being said, I heavily recommend reading [this SABR article](https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/integration-1947-1986) on the rate of integration before jumping to any conclusions.

"Hi all,

I am new to Sabermetrics, but I am not new to data analysis or baseball.

My two primary goals with the code I have written and made available on Github are:

* to make the Retrosheet data easier to analyze
* to allow for repeatable research

Repeatable research means to make publicly available the scripts which download, process and analyze the data so that anyone can verify the results.  I started by computing the Park Factor for all teams for several years and found that Fangraphs and ESPN both made the same mistake for Fenway Park in 2019, namely that they included the runs the Red Sox and Yankees scored in London as if they were runs scored in Fenway Park.  That is, the Park Factors published by Fangraphs and ESPN are too high for Fenway Park in 2019.

The scripts also automatically parse the Retrosheet data using the cwevent, cwdaily and cwgame parsers.  That output is then collected into ""tidy"" CSV files and an optional script is provided which loads the data into Postgres tables.

I also created Jupyter Notebooks to use the Retrosheet data to:

* compute the Park Factor for each team's home park and compare with web scraped data from Fangraphs
* compute the game-weighted average Park Factor on the road for each team
* compute linear weights using linear regression (similar to the first step in computing wOBA) using play-by-play data aggregated to the half-inning level

There's a lot already out there about umpires' making errant strike calls, but I'd like to do a bit of a deeper dive here and see precisely how the umps' propensity to fall prey to the gambler's fallacy can influence at bats (and thus games) and make a Youtube video about it.

I'm a little confused about sample size and stabilization and I was wondering if someone could point out what I'm missing, if anything. Let's use strikeout-rate as an example.  


So, as far as I can tell, strikeout rate is measuring a binomial distribution, right? In any plate appearance, a player either strikes out or he doesn't. A typical strikeout-rate is like 20%, right?  


So, fangraphs has the stabilization point for strike-out rate at 60 ab. 

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://library.fangraphs.com/principles/sample-size/](https://library.fangraphs.com/principles/sample-size/) 

&amp;#x200B;

But if this is a binomial distribution, and we look at a confidence interval around, say, 60 attempts with 12 strikouts, we see this really huge confidence interval. That strikeout rate would be 20%, but the 95% confidence interval would be 10.7% - 32.3%, a frankly huge interval.

 [https://statpages.info/confint.html](https://statpages.info/confint.html)  (plug in 12 for numerator and 60 for denominator)

I noticed while working with some statcast data that the post\_away\_score and post\_home\_score fields are not correct on any scoring pitch. Consequently the post\_bat\_score and post\_field\_score metrics are also wrong. The only reason I noticed was because I was getting ties while running some stats... it turned out those were walk offs.

My understanding is that on a scoring pitch, the post\_home\_score should be more than the home\_score field of that same pitch if the scoring team was the home team. Is this correct?

If not, is there a way to report this bug to baseball savant?",Sabermetrics

"I had thought in the shower the other day on how to measure a batters ""eye"". In other words how well does someone recognize a pitch and where it's going to end up.

The metric would be to measure every pitch that a batter saw that was just outside the strikezone ( a baseball width) and see if it ended up in a favorable result. For now I'm thinking a favorable result would be 

* a ball or a called strike
* a well hit ball
* a foul if there are two strikes in the count

Then do an average of favorable results vs all edge chances. It would be a ""plus"" statistic, so it would be normalized to the whole league. I'm thinking about calling it ""eye+"". It would be sort of peripheral counterpart to OBP and can be used as an indicator for someone who is about to break out of a slump because he's ""seeing the ball well""

"So, I’m 24 and just left baseball. I’ve been very open about my jadedness towards the industry after three years of backbreaking work, false promises, and lots and lots of lessons learned. I worked for three teams, left all of them on very good terms and references, but realized the life is unsustainable. The path to full time really isn’t the undergrad in business/sport management/etc and then moving up through affiliate positions - which is something I’ve come to realize.

Nowadays, I quit. And I’m on the job hunt. However, on LinkedIn, I see all these people making the same decisions I did a few years ago. I frequently have people message me for jobs, advice, etc. Like...a year spent in Pennsylvania at a Sport Info Solutions followed by 2-4 years in video maybe leads to something else full time 10% of the time. I generally now refer to this path as “Video Hell.”

Anyway, I’ve debated opening a blog up for my own Independent work and research. I haven’t completely counted out a return to baseball one day - but it’ll be after I establish myself elsewhere and have more to offer that teams simply can’t provide. I’ve debated a first post about warning people about the track I fell into. And I don’t fully regret my path - but with hindsight being 2020, I’d do my first two years of college working in finance, economics, info tech, etc, work on a blog on the side and then apply to teams to try and skip the affiliate process - or at the very least, just do it for one year.

It just sort of pains me to see people who are 18-20 that are impressionable and always dreamed about wearing a team logo on their chest fall into a similar trap. So in short, would a blog post with some in depth direction be particularly helpful to post on LinkedIn where I have a lot of reach? Would I be sabotaging myself for future opportunities with teams one day in the future (they all know that track being the gateway to FT is BS anyway)? Maybe my opinion doesn’t matter either way and I shouldn’t say anything. But, I see the topic come up a lot and as someone who’s progressively moved up in baseball each year (TM, Video, Affiliate Analyst), I just want to try and help some people out with advice if I can, without totally sabotaging my reputation.",Sabermetrics

"I think, from a sabermetric perspective, the consensus of a really good hitter drawing down a bunt is frowned upon - or more so discouraged. However, I've been hating the concept of it more and more, as I've been watching a lot of lower level baseball where I currently reside this summer. 

So, let's say there's a prospect (not necessarily top ranked, but has a batted ball profile that exhibits very strong power but a lot of it is to the pull side and he has trouble chasing a lot of pitches. Teams begin to put down a shift. From a player development perspective for an organization, why at a low level would you have that hitter start dropping bunts to the third base side? 

I get the concept of it - there is nobody at third because of the positioning and if he can learn to drop bunts that way, they may re-think how they position. But, I believe it's a waste of a powerful hitter's strength - and at the lower levels of development, I don't see why he wouldn't be taught to work towards beating the shifts with his mechanics, instead of focusing on bunts. 

I get bunts are part of the game, and it will be taught to everyone at all levels. However, I've seen it a lot this year with gusy who have legitimate power in situations where a bunt isn't needed (a game where they have a large lead already, for instance). 

Is there any defense for that? I just think your taking away that hitter's best qualities and it feels to me that helping him learn to spray the ball a bit more at a low level isn't the best approach.",Sabermetrics

"In the *People* table of the [Lahman database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), there is a column called *finalGame*. The [documentation](http://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2019.txt) states:

&gt; finalGame      Date that player made first major league appearance (blank if still active)

First, I assume that the use of the word 'first' is a copy/paste error (the previous column is *debut*) and it should be 'last'.

But more importantly, the way I am interpreting this is that active players should not have a date here. For example, I would expect that both Carlos Martinez and Matt Carpenter would have a NULL value for this column (assuming I am querying a SQL database). Yet they, and most other active players, do have a date in that column.

The date they have makes sense -- it seems like it's the last game they appeared in. But still, it doesn't match what I would expect.

I should note that I've tried this in the *Lahman* R package and in the SQL Server 2018 version.

"I'm looking at calculating run expectancies given play-by-play data and had a question regarding which base/out state to use for a given play.

Say Mike Trout walks to the plate with Andrelton Simmons standing on first and none out in the inning. The first pitch Trout takes and Simmons legs it for second base, attempting a steal. The count is now either 1-0 or 0-1 and Simmons is either OUT or SAFE. So the at-bat began with a state of 0-100 and now it is either 1-000 or 0-010. Also the count has changed and we are into the at-bat.

The question is: Should we use the play state right before the at-bat is resolved? (i.e. on the pitch the plate appearance ends) or should we use the base/out state as Trout walks to the plate?

My initial thoughts would be to use the state as Trout walks to the plate. This way when we're comparing states with other states, we're always using the same count: 0-0.

"  

I was listening to the Sleeper and the Bust podcast, Steamer Pitching Projections (episode 754), where Paul Sporer mentioned that he believed in Mike Soroka's Home Run Suppression capabilities. 

Mike Soroka had the following stats in 2019: 

ERA: 2.68 

SIERA: 4.17

xFIP: 3.85 

HR/9: 0.72 

HR/FB: 11% 

GB %: 51% 

FB %: 25% 

K/9: 7.3 

Normally I would look at: HR/9, FB%, and HR/FB% in tandem. Perhaps along with the park the guy pitches in, and their velocity. 

League wide HR/9 was 1.40, and HR/FB was 15.3% 

I'm guessing most projection systems will look at the 7.3 DOM, low HR/9, and HR/FB relative to the league average and move his projections closer to the xFIP and SIERA.  Steamer is projecting a 1.16 HR/9, and ERA of 4.12.  

My question is, any idea where Paul Sporer would have been looking under the hood to identify liking Soroka's HR suppression capabilities? Are there additional things to look at like # of pitches, command, etc. that can serve as a validating stat to support HR suppression?",Sabermetrics

"Maybe it seems like a dumb question, but I've had a hard time tracking down the answer. Normally, batting average is calculated in terms of the result of an at-bat. Does that mean that when a hitter has a .278 avg ""against fastballs,"" we're only talking about the fastballs that ended an at-bat? 

That seems a lot more specific and ambiguous than how the stat is usually cited, i.e. as a shorthand for how a hitter will do against a pitcher with a particular repertoire. It doesn't seem to me like it would actually tell us very much on its own--we can't say a hitter ""crushes fastballs"" if we really mean that in particular situations that are more likely to result in at-bats ending they crush fastballs. What if they are great on 3-2 fastballs but frequently watch meatballs early in the count? Or if it's very easy to get them to whiff against a particular pitch for their second strike but not their third? What is their average against a kind of pitch really telling us, then?",Sabermetrics

As for my initial thoughts--I've looked into how Tom Tango formulated wOBA in *The Book,* which is based on the run values of events relative to making an out and re-scaled to look like OBP. I've also read about xwOBA which sounds quite similar. Perhaps the idea is to use the batted ball characteristics to model the probability of each possible batted ball event happening (single, double, triple, or HR), pick the one with highest probability, and call that the ""expected outcome."" Then, can we use the same wOBA weights for each batted ball outcome? What are your thoughts?",Sabermetrics

"Not sure this is the right forum for this question, but here it goes...

I've been giving some thought recently to how large a sample you would need differences in **Brls/BBE** to be statistically significant. As we might remember from Stats 101, the standard construction of a binomial standard error is:

**se=sqrt[p(1-p)/n]**

This essentially assumes a support of [0, 1]. But with something like **Brls/BBE**, we know empirically that the support is more like [0, 0.30]. That is, no one has a **Brls/BBE** of 100%; rather, the upper-bound is somewhere around 30% (it's only exceed 25% twice: Gallo in 2019, Judge in 2017). 

Why not construct the standard error to reflect that support? That is:

**se=sqrt[p(0.3-p)/n]**

Here's an example to illustrate the issue: Say I want to construct a confidence interval for Kyle Lewis (23% in 43 BBE) having a **Brls/BBE** above league-average (6.3%). If I use the regular standard error, then I confidence interval of approximately (0.10, 0.36). That upper-bound seems implausible based on past performance of players over the past five years of Statcast data (i.e., no one has anything close to a 36% **Brls/BBE**). It's also not terribly informative, since the inference is that Lewis is either a bit above average or epically good. 

However, if I use the alternative standard error based on a support of [0, 0.30], the interval shrinks to (0.19, 0.27), which is both more precise and also more plausible on its face. 

To provide some additional context, to get a +/- 0.04 on a 23% **Brls/BBE**, you'd need a sample of about 400 BBE; that is, an order of magnitude greater than the 43 BBE we got from Kyle Lewis in 2019. Obviously more data is always better, but given the relatively narrow support of **Brls/BBE**, shouldn't we be able to narrow down the standard error some?

I've done some looking at some statistics texts, but haven't seen this specifically addressed. Which surprises me, since I would think that it would be widely used if it were mathematically sound given that there are obvious applications besides sabremetrics. So is there an obvious reason why you wouldn't want to do what I'm suggesting?

"I'm currently reading *The Book*, and am trying to understand some regression to the mean calculations. At the very end of the first chapter ""Toolshed"", the authors give an example regarding 162 players who posted a wOBA of .370 or better for a full season between 2000 and 2003, and who had at least 400 PA in the .370 season and the following season. In the .370 season, they averaged a wOBA of .406. In the next, they averaged .391. At a high level, I understand that this is exactly what regression to the mean is.

However, later, they describe that calculating regression to the mean involves adding a number of average performances to a player's actual performance. In the context of the above example, they say that ""if we want to estimate a player's likely wOBA next season, we need to add approximately 220 average plate appearances to his totals."" My question is: how did they get this number? I've read and re-read the regression section in the appendix to try and understand, but am still a bit confused. In particular, there are some formulas in the appendix that take the form of:

    skill = mean(wOBA) + N/(N + .25/sigma^2)*(wOBA- mean(wOBA)).

Then, they use this formula to find the number of PAs needed to find the break-even point for regression, which is also a bit murky for me.

So, where exactly are these formulas coming from, and how can we use it to figure out the number of PAs, or the ""break-even"" point, for regression to the mean?

Lastly, how is this kind of regression related to a supervised learning technique like ordinary least squares? I've been studying some statistical learning, and it feels like there must be a connection here that might help my understanding!

"I’ve posted here the other day about some career issues I’m having. I’m 24 and a Sport Management major from a reputable university/program, but I’m obviously not well equipped to be an Analyst with that degree. I’ve worked for three baseball teams and have very solid references and left all three on very good terms with invites to return. The issue is I’m finding no opportunities to grow to full time. I didn’t know when I was 18 and signing up for Sport Management what that landscape would look like - but my current hard skills are very business centric - presentations, speaking, marketing, research, communication, sole analytics and info tech, etc. I finished with a 3.4. I work my absolute tail off. I’m not like a NASA genius, but I’ve finally gained confidence over the past 3 years that I can make a difference. 

Through my work experience with teams, I’ve gained experience with SQL and R, but nothing profoundly complex. Basic queries and visualizations. Nothing crazy, it’s been too inconsistent. I tried a Computer Science program and utterly hated it. Admittedly it was a bad program that’s since closed but I just didn’t like the vibe, the work of developing and coding 24/7, etc. What I love is sort of on the research end. And this will sounds vague. But I love querying large data sets, problem solving, and using analytical data to come to conclusions/projections. If that makes sense.

Anyway, Sport Management is useless - I realize this. But I need to make my Master’s degree count for the money I’m going to spend. I need something useful and unique - but also something where I’ll even be accepted and can thrive from the Sport Management background (for instance, I can’t do a Master’s in Physics. I’m awful at intensive science and have one high school class of it under my belt). I need something where I can become a Data Analyst and be a wide appealing option to multiple fields where earnings are more possible. I want to cast a wider net than sports. I know there’s Business Analytics, Data Science, etc. I just need guidance and don’t know what’s widely useful and renowned, or even where to start.

"I’ve posted this once before but wanted to get some additional input if possible. 

Long story short, I’m at a crossroads in my professional baseball career. I’ll be 25 next year and so far I’ve worked for three teams - each year getting more experience and more exposure than the last. All I’ve ever gotten is praise for my position, I’m always one of very few to be invited back, but there’s not much of a path for me to grow.

The past three years have all been affiliate assignments. I was finally able to leave video job hell, but my hours were still full travel, 80 hours a week, and so mentally exhausting. I’m predisposed to depression and the season schedule (14 off days from Feb thru Aug) really did a number on me. Bad hotels hurt, bad dieting, etc. It’s not the life for me anymore and not something I think I need to do anymore. 

I feel accomplished in my field based on feedback alone. I’m not the most confident person but I know every year I’m growing. But as the offseason begins and I’m reaching out and applying, I’m starting to lose hope that a full time job is attainable. I will sacrifice and work long hours and kill myself for my dream job - but the affiliate schedule is no longer doable. I need to find one place to live for at least two years and be able to both work and prioritize my mental health - and I don’t think I’m weak for acknowledging that. 

Okay, this has been sort of a rant. But, I’m genuinely looking for advice what to do next. I cold message 30 people a day on LinkedIn, i cold email, etc. Skill wise, I’m not a computer scientist - but I just got admitted to grad school. But I can’t start it until I have a location set and I know I can handle it. I tried it in season and it was way too overwhelming, I have very basic code ability, and worked on it pretty extensively hands on this year, but I couldn’t do anything consistently because the travel utterly kills me. 

I’m just wondering if there’s a place for me in baseball. I do need some kind of sustainable income. I live alone and don’t come from much of any privilege. I go on LinkedIn and all these people from MIT, who worked at NASA, studied finance, and it’s not me. I went to a good school for a business degree and was admitted to a good grad school, but sometimes I think it isn’t enough. I have so many good references though. And I haven’t gotten FT simply because it hasn’t been there. But I have recommendations from MLB analysts, MLB hitting coaches, PD Staff etc all telling me I do well. And I know my greatest strengths are  communication, empathy and thinking outside the box. But, I don’t know what’s next. I need something more doable for my mental health - and because I feel there’s nothing left for me growth-wise at the same old affiliate jobs.

For companies like Google and Facebook there are people all across the planet (USA, India, China, Australia, Morocco, etc you get the point) who can take a computer, learn to code, and be qualified candidates. Yet they still pay six figures for entry level engineers. If the pay is so low, are the candidates 'really' that good? 

2) Not to be all SJW, but the low pay really does limit the type of guys working in front offices. Brandon Taubman types, guys who are rich enough to go to Ivy League schools, take on near minimum wage intern pay, etc. 

I don't mean to put a damper on this sub, but I saw how the Indians post spurred some good discussion, so just wanted to keep the conversation going. Thoughts?",Sabermetrics

Most of the time, I use Statcast Data and try to transform it into something useful. But, I have stumbled across some Trackman data and would like to try some new things with it.

"Long story short, I’ve been working in pro ball for about three years now - each year getting more in depth roles than the last. I have a lot of really good references, and I’ve been told by everyone I’ve gone above and beyond and killed myself to stand out....but each September it ends with me jobless, on the hunt, and filling out questionnaires. 

Honestly, I feel burned out. I love baseball. It’s my life and I know I’ll never be truly fulfilled doing anything else. But, I didn’t just put cameras up for teams this year - I was very involved and put everything I had in. And things just didn’t pan out, no openings. And I’m just tired. Tired from road travel, intense work, 80 hour weeks....I’m not doing it again next year, not that schedule. I need to find some sort of full-time job by now. 

I’ll do my usual cold emails and getting in touch with people I know, but I’m tired of the process. It’s so stressful not having a job every 7-8 months, and feeling like all my work has been for nothing. And I won’t give up, but I’m not the same 20 year old who could afford this financially, mentally, or even physically. 

At this point....I’m trying to cast a wide net. To people who have been in my spot and can relate or otherwise, does anyone know of other companies where I can do a similar line of work in baseball, but just where the schedule is less agonizing and there’s more consistency? I just don’t know the path. I’m still young, but I sacrificed mind/body/soul with the schedule I had this year, and I cannot do it again. And I don’t think I’m weak for doing so.

"Every serious baseball fan agrees that game location can affect the outcome of the game. This ""park effect"" is difficult to measure. If known, it could be used to hypothesize game results when the park effect was removed thus providing an apples-to-apples set of performance measurements of teams and players. Different methods for measuring park effect have been proposed and there is general agreement as to which MLB parks are batter-friendly and which are pitcher-friendly. For example, in 2018 the Rockies' Coors Field is considered the most batter-friendly and the Oakland Coliseum is at the least batter-friendly and therefore the most pitcher-friendly.

RunPlusMinus has developed unique performance statistics that not only measure the on-field performance of the four components (batting, running, pitching, fielding) but more important RunPlusMinus provides a single numeric measure representing the composite performance of each player. This RunPlusMinus Rating statistic allows offensive and defensive players to be compared on the same scale.

"Hi everybody. I manage a men's league team and I've been trying to figure out which stat I can implement to reveal my best offensive players. I'd love to get this group's thoughts and guidance...  

Last year I relied mostly on wOBA, which seemed to work fairly well but I think it had some limitations. wOBA is for weighted the highest level of competition, so it discounts some of the variance of ability level found in lower levels of play a little too much for my purposes. So I set out to see how other coaches apply advanced stats at these levels. After reading [this article](https://www.crawfishboxes.com/2013/5/23/4360702/high-school-and-sabr-part-2-offensive-philosophy), the coach/author reaches a conclusion that I very much agree with: getting on base and putting balls in play is even more valuable at lower levels to put pressure on defenses and allow them to make mistakes and benefit your team.  

So now I'm trying to see if I can adjust these well-established stats to account for the non-MLB ability levels found in our league. I've come up with a slightly modified version of wOBAbip. I'm using the [FanGraphs weights](https://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/woba/) for the numerator. For the denominator, I started with babip's but I took out home runs because I want this to be a primarily offensive measure of a player's weighted offensive value so I want to count HR's as balls in play. So here's the formula...  

[(0.69*BB)+(0.72*HBP)+(0.89*(1B+RBOE))+(1.27*2B)+(1.62*3B)+(2.1*HR)]/(AB-K+SF)

"Hi, 

I'm a noob to the Sabermetrics world and am trying to find a way to find a particular type of data (if it exists). What I'm trying to do is find specific base/out scenarios for specific games and the ensuing results based on these situations. 

For instance I would like to find data on a teams win expectancy when the team is losing in the top of the 9th, the bases are loaded with no outs, and the score is 5 to 2. Then I would like to compare this to a teams win expectancy in the exact same scenario but the score is 6 to 2. 

Again, I'm not sure if there is a publicly available dataset that could describe these situations. I've been toying with the Baseball Reference Index but can't seem to find what I want. Thank you for your help. ",Sabermetrics
"Heya,

I'm not a stat head at all, so apologies if this is a) a super obvious question or b) a super ridiculous question. I'm totally down with what you SABR-minded folks are up to, but I'm not fluent (or even really all that conversant) in the language.

Anyway, I'm trying to find a statistic that I read someone describe about a decade ago. I remember reading about it while sitting at a desk at a job I had from 2007-2010, so I think it was new(ish) around that time (or perhaps just new to whomever was writing about it). It was meant to replace pitcher wins and losses by scoring each pitcher's contribution to the game, so that if, say, a starting pitcher pitches nine dominant innings in a  0-0 game, but gets pulled for the 10th and is not the pitcher of record when his team scores a walk-off run in extra innings, he would still be credited with the highest score and thus the highest contribution. It's kind of like win shares, but pitcher specific; sort of like game score, except all the pitchers are scored; it's straight up meant to be a replacement to awarding Ws and Ls in the box score. Is this sounding like a statistic anyone's familiar with? ",Sabermetrics

"**What is DingerDB?**


- DingerDB is a database populated with MLB data including data points such as players, venues, umpires, games, and even down to each pitch for each game for years 2008 until current day. (Note that currently 2008 is the earliest data we’ve acquired, but more will be pulled when we have time). The frontend is an Apache open source data analysis tool called Superset which allows for real time querying of the data along with dashboards that can visualize data. We have automated the pulling and parsing of data so DingerDB will always remain up to date.

**What is the purpose?**

- We had the inspiration from retrosheets and the lahman database to try and make something that included current data that had much more granularity than both of those that included modern data such as pitchfx. We also thought it would be interesting to try and figure out any correlations derived from the verbose data.

**Who are we?**

- We are a few software engineers who enjoy baseball and have some experience with data processing and indexing so it seemed like a good idea for a side project. With that said, if there are any features that are requested we will try to accommodate them as best we can if they are possible and our schedules allow for it.

**What do we want?**

- To promote the use of DingerDB by providing a reliable, easy to use, and up to date source of baseball data.

**How do I get access?**

- Its now open to the public!

- [DingerDB](https://dingerdb.com/superset/sqllab)

**What's new with DingerDB?**

- We've made it so you can access the sqllab page directly without having to have an account! Now you can query without having to ask us for a login.

**Why would I have a login in the first place?**

- If you want to save queries or dashboards to your personal space then you will still need a login.

**What can I do to help?**

- We've a patreon here with various options, all proceeds will go improving the site and hosting fees for larger instances or site improvements.
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dinger_db)
- If all you want to do is enjoy some baseball data like ourselves then feel free to access the site anytime!

"As a part of a class project, we had to propose and calculate two new statistics. For my project, I created the following two statistics. A full [proposal](https://github.com/brandonzink/Sabermetrics-Project/blob/master/Project%20Proposal.pdf), [write-up](https://github.com/brandonzink/Sabermetrics-Project/blob/master/Project%20Writeup.pdf), [explanation video](https://youtu.be/4OFdErojqLs), and [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/brandonzink/Sabermetrics-Project) can be found at those links.
  
#**%TBA**  
  
%TBA is a calculation similar to RBI. Instead of only valuing when a runner crosses the plate, this statistic values any amount of movement on the bases, unweighted on which bases are moved (going from second to home carries the same value as going first to third). It then weights the total bases advanced by all baserunners (including the batter) divided by the total possible bases (if every runner crossed home). It is not a cumulative statistic, but instead adds up both TBA (total bases advanced) and TPBA (total possible bases advanced) over a season, then divides.  
  
Ex: With runners on first and second, the batter hits a single that scores the runner from second and moves the runner from first to second.  
TBA = 2 (second to home) + 2 (first to third) + 1 (batter to first)  
TPBA = 2 (second to home) + 3 (first to home) + 4 (batter to home)  
%TBA = 5 TBA / 9 TPBA = 0.555  
This is a pretty good result from the AB, as a groundout that moved no one would result in a 0/9 = 0.000 score for that play.  
  


Player | Year | %TBA | WAR
------|----|----|---
Mike Trout | 2012 | 0.272 | 10.5
Joey Votto | 2010 | 0.265 | 7.0
Paul Goldschmidt | 2013 | 0.261 | 7.1  
  
The top 3 players from my samples (2010 - 2015) are shown above as a reference. Mike Trout was dick-slapping everyone around in 2012, and it shows in his %TBA. Votto and Goldy both had very good seasons in their appropriate years, and it also shows in their %TBA.   
  
#**REC**  
REC (Runs Earned Created) is not dissimilar to the %TBA stat but instead uses the RE24 table to weight the outcome of a play. REC is also a cumulative stat (which is eventually it's downfall and looking retrospectively, I probably should've done a %REC stat). REC takes the RE24 value from the end of a play, subtracts the RE24 at the start of the play, and adds the total runs scored over that play.  
  
Ex: With runners on first and second and one out, the batter hits a single that scores the runner from second and moves the runner from first to second.  
RE24 before play = 0.884  
RE24 after play = 1.13  
Runs scored = 1  
REC = (1.13 - 0.884) + 1 = 1.246  
The play not only scored a run but also increased the expected number of runs for the next guy at the plate, making this an extremely good player. A negative play can happen as well, especially hurtful ones are stuff like GIDP.  


Player | Year | REC | WAR
------|----|---|---
Chris Davis | 2013 | 158.4 | 6.5
Miggy Cabrera | 2011 | 158.3 | 7.6
Hunter Pence | 2011 | 156 | 5.8
  
Looking at that list, you can pretty immediately tell that this stat has its flaws. It's far too AB dependent (if you watch the explanation video, you can see a graph that really shows it). I don't consider REC to be a particularly good stat, but who knows, maybe you like AB dependent stats dominated by good to great players. I guess you could use it to knock Mike Trout.

"I am very new to this forum and reddit in general (this is my first reddit post ever) so please forgive me if this is an improper post....  

I am interested in creating a metric that measures how strongly a manager should consider intentionally walking a batter.  What I envision is something that accounts for the runs saved by issuing an intentional walk (affected by the runners-on-base state and the number of outs) and is weighted according to the leverage index of the situation.  Ideally the metric would be scaled from 0 to 1 for ease of use in game situations, with a value of, say, 0.99 meaning that a manager should issue an intentional walk basically every time, while a value of 0.1 would mean a manager should only issue an intentional walk in the most unfavorable 10% of matchup situations.  My theory is that managers misuse the intentional walk quite often because they typically face the decision in high pressure situations and are forced to decide quickly with imperfect information (they cant know if their pitcher will execute good pitches or if the hitter will swing at bad pitches etc...) and thus such a metric would be helpful in optimizing decision making.  In practice, the metric would serve as a baseline with the manager's intuition coming in to play when considering how unfavorable a given matchup is (which of course depends on many factors such as the hitter on deck, pitcher/hitter performance on that day, whether a given hitter is hot, past pitcher/hitter matchup data etc...).  Does anybody have any knowledge of something similar existing, or any advice on where I could start with regards to creating something new?

"I've read a lot of discussions comparing players with similar OPS, and the point always comes up that if two players have an identical OPS (really, an identical OPS+), the one with the higher OBP and lower SLG is the more valuable. There's even a conversion such that 1 point of OBP is actually worth (to make up a value for illustrative purposes) 1.5 points of slugging. 

I assume that this comes from detailed analyses showing that OBP is a better predictor of scoring more runs. However, I've never seen the data that lead to this conclusion, and it recently occurred to me that maybe part of the difference is in the two measures having different denominators. To be more precise, since OBP has plate appearances as its denominator, and SLG has at bats (which by definition will never be more than PA, and in practice will always be smaller than PA), it takes more of whatever quantity comprises your numerator (times on base or total bases, respectively) to raise your value by one point. 

If we could come up with a measure for slugging that was based on plate appearances instead of at bats, would that measure be closer to OBP in predictive value? There are, of course, some serious logistical problems: either you include non-hit times on base, in which case you're both amalgamating OBP and SLG, and also creating a cap of sorts for players who walk a lot, since each walk can only generate a single base; or you exclude non-hit times on base, in which case you're penalizing players who walk a lot because their denominator will increase by much more than players who don't. 

I'm not sure it's possible to create this hypothetical SLG based on plate appearances in any useful way. But if it *were* possible, how far would that go in equalizing the value of OBP and SLG in comparing players?",Sabermetrics

"From reading a lot of the more advanced sabermetric papers in the public, I've noticed a high usage of mixed effects models. I understand that these models are generally used because they can account for correlation between the response variable throughout the dataset. However, something that I find puzzling is that these mixed effects models are often used to actually estimate the value of the random effect. In my experience in statistics, mixed effects models are generally used to account for correlated data, but the inclusion of these random effects are just variance adjustments where the purpose of the model is to more accurately estimate the impact of the fixed effects on the response, and they are generally not explicitly estimated.

Take for example this article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-baseballs-exit-velocity-is-five-parts-hitter-one-part-pitcher/

All I know about it is that there was a strike zone and they were keeping track of some data. I believe that it was more than simple pitch tracking. So my question is if anyone on this sub knows what software or program they were using and if it was available to the general public, or if there are any similar softwares/programs that I could download and use for my own benefit.

I'm beginning my journey into working and playing with baseball data after a very long time of being interested in it. I have a decent and developing background in data analysis and data science. I've done some basic work with R and the large, standard data sets such as the Lahman database. 

My question is this: what are some other good, maybe more advanced, free databases I can use? I'm looking for something more complex and interesting than just the traditional statistics recorded in the Lahman database, for example. If you have a few recommendations, go right ahead and list them, and if you could just give a brief description of what they are a good resource for it would be GREATLY appreciated.

Hey there!

I did some visualizations about batting for the 2018 regular season. You can see them here: [https://berndschmidl.com/2018/11/20/every-plate-appearance-in-the-2018-mlb-season-visualized/](https://berndschmidl.com/2018/11/20/every-plate-appearance-in-the-2018-mlb-season-visualized/)

Now I need your help! I want to refine the charts and put them in a dashboard so you can see those for every team and player. But for that I have to calculate the Left on Base stat. They are there for Teams, this is why I can test my calculation, but not for players. I'm using data from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com/) and here is what I have so far:

I calculate people who came on base like this: Hits (without HRs) + BB (both IBB and UBB) + HBP + Catchers Interference + Reached on Error.

Then, in order to calculate the LOB from this number of people who reached base I substract:Runs (without HRs), Caught Stealing, Pickoff and Out on Base.

The problem is, when I compare this constructed LOB with the actual statistic from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com/) I constantly have around 100 too many LOBs in my constructed number (for Teams). So there must be something every other game that I'm missing and I can't figure it out.

Either I'm counting too less people who reached base or I forget something how else people who are on base can get out or something else. I'm not sure about the Grounded into Double Play but when I take them in I construct a bit too less LOBs.

How else can one get on base or how else can someone get out etc.?

Help really appreciated!",Sabermetrics
"As a part of my undergrad thesis, I'm looking to create a short-term player projection model (~2 weeks) for a fairly common array of statistics (BA, OBP, SLG, HR%, K%, BB%). However, I've run into some issues and was looking for some input/ideas from the baseball minds here.  
  
I began by using a recency weighted function applied to the last n games (anywhere from 5 to 500 games back) and comparing them to the most recent two weeks of data for every starting player in the MLB. If the sample size was insufficient (rookies, etc.), I created a composite stat of their stats in the small sample size and replacement level (I found this to be better than MLB average), with weights determined by the sample size. The correlation coefficients were low (anywhere from .200 to .500). I removed the recency weighted function and this improved the coefficients slightly, but still not into an acceptable range.  
  
I then took a different approach and got every stat I could find for every major league starter and ran a linear regression on the stats from above over the most recent two weeks. This created a model that had significant inputs (p val &lt;.05) but a weak R-Squared and Adj. R-Squared values (.150 to .250).  
  
In examining plots of the data comparing the most recent two weeks of stats versus the last 100 games, I found that BA, OBP, and SLG were essentially a giant blob (with some linear correlation but minimal), HR% shows no signs of a correlation (there are also quite a few players with a HR% of .000 over the last two weeks), and BB% and K% had the most obvious linear correlation. I tried adjusting for the ""blobiness"" of BA, OBP, and SLG by eliminating any players that were especially streaky (their standard deviation for the specific stat was at least double the MLB average standard deviation). This improved both the correlation coefficients and R-Squared values, but still not into a particularly acceptable range.  
  
My next best guess is to use a publicly available projection system (Steamer, Zips) and see which projects best over a short-term period. Do any of you have any additional ideas or comments regarding a way to improve my methodology? Any help is appreciated!",Sabermetrics

"This will be in depth post about me and my love for baseball.

So I’m a 16 year old (sophomore in high school) and in the past couple years my interest for baseball has piqued. Personally, I’ve never played the sport competitively other then little league, but I’ve started to love watching the sport after my fandom of the packers started to wane. I grew up in a a Suburb of Chicago for my first 14 years where football was my number one sport. I was an avid Packers fan (both my parents went to college in Wisconsin, my Dad lived in a town near Milwaukee his whole life and has a lot of his family there), as a young football fan I was pretty invested into the Packers but as I grew older the packers started to become less functional and during the long stretches of the off season I found myself bored and found my love in baseball. As a 5th grader I intently remember following the brewers for the first time, and was devastated after they collapsed in 2014. I took a break but then moving to California  in 2017 I became obsessed to the Brewers. My friends were also baseball enthusiasts and I found it as a great way to connect. The 2017 season passed and my interest for football started to considerably wane and baseball became my number 1 sport.  I followed the off season greatly and my baseball interest heightened greatly in 2018. (Admittedly because the brewers were an elite team this year). However in 2018 my interest for sabermetrics  kicked in and I discovered Fangraphs (I don’t use baseball reference) and twitter. I started to use advanced stats and I got a blogging job at Fansided. 

For the past couple years baseball has been one of my passions but I don’t know how to apply it to my real life. I’m a pretty good student in school however I don’t take that many advanced classes. I play tennis, and am pretty well rounded but i want to use my passion into something that will help me when I go to college. Other interests I have are finance, econ and statistics. I’m not sure exactly what I want to do in college but something involving analytics and baseball (like moneyball) would be great. 

My dad is a software engineer in San Francisco and has encouraged me how to learn how to code, (js) and after trying it out I did not like it. 

So I was wondering if you guys could give me a nudge in the right direction, I’m looking on how to start a cool baseball project or something that would be meaningful in my life for the off season. Thanks guys.",Sabermetrics

"Last year, I worked with a collegiate summer team working with the manager to calculate &amp; keep advanced stats. I had a working spreadsheet that I would plug and they would spit out the numbers I wanted. I used this to try &amp; translate what he was seeing on the field to put a value on certain aspects. One problem was that I was doing it remotely as I lived too far away. There was a live stream that I would occasionally watch but I just was not able to devote as much time to watch every game as I wanted. I would essentially go into the box score and use the information there to get what I needed &amp; throw it into spreadsheets. Thankfully, it was a pretty detailed box score which included pitch by pitch sequences.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I was thinking about this upcoming summer and was wondering what recommendations or ideas this group might have.  I was able to calculate the basic stats (OBP, OPS, SLG, ERA) as well as most traditional advanced stats (wOBA, WRC+, FIP, splits &amp; situational stats, etc) that allow me to dive a little bit deeper but my main goal was to see if anybody had any ideas or suggestions on how I could further read between the lines.

Another simpler example is the necessity of having groundball pitchers in a Colts Field (to prevent homeruns). So, I was wondering how I could go about researching this topic and collecting relevant stats.

"Here is a note that proposes a new novel method for directly calculating wins above replacement:

[https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/5/2398/files/2019/03/causalWARyadi-1mwhtjl.pdf](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/5/2398/files/2019/03/causalWARyadi-1mwhtjl.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some interesting excerpts in the attached paper:

&amp;#x200B;

Wins above replacement (WAR) is meant to be a one-number summary of the total contribution made by a player for his team in any particular season.  As stated by Steve Slowinski of Fangraphs, WAR offers an estimate to answer the question, 

  \`\`If this player got injured and their team had to replace them with a  freely available player of lower quality from their bench, how much value would the team be losing,'' 

where this value is expressed in number of wins \[citation in paper\].  That being said, nobody actually calculates WAR in a manner that properly answers the above question as posed.  This is not by any fault of the metric and those who calculate it.  One problem is that it is impossible to simultaneously quantify the value of a player when the player is available and the value of a replacement to that player when the player is unavailable.  The player in question is either available to play or unavailable to play, never both.  Instead of confronting the problems raised in this factual-counterfactual world, people have attempted to calculate a hypothetical replacement player to implicitly compare every player with using the machinery of a proprietary black box \[citation in paper\].  Three widely used versions of WAR that are calculated in this manner are Baseball Reference's bWAR \[citation in paper\], Fangraphs's fWAR \[citation in paper\], and Baseball Prospectus's bWARP \[citation in paper\].

&amp;#x200B;

In this note, we propose a direct estimator of wins above replacement that confronts the difficulty of the factual-counterfactual real world.  Note that there are numerous examples of seasons in which a player is available and unavailable for a substantial amount of time.  When this is so, we can directly compare how the team performs when the player is available to how the team performs when the player is unavailable.  This framework allows for a direct estimation of the wins that a player adds above a replacement player. This direct estimator is relatively simple to compute, available, easy to understand, and its interpretation is flexible to the narrative of a season. We will refer to this direct calculation of WAR as dWAR, which is short for direct WAR, which is shorthand for the direct calculation of wins above replacement. The dWAR estimator has the potential to yield a much more natural and appropriate estimate of WAR than those which involve the calculation of a hypothetical replacement player via black box methodology.  The validity of dWAR depends on the team and the competition faced by the team being similar duringboth player states.  Very nuanced interpretations of what dWAR measures emerge when team makeup is confounded with the availability of the player in question. 

&amp;#x200B;

We primarily focus on the 2014 Yadier Molina season to show the discrepancies between conventional calculations of WAR and dWAR.  Our version of WAR gives much more value to Yadier Molina's 2014 season than conventional versions.  This result is far from surprising.  Many note that conventional versions of WAR do not properly account for leadership, game management, pitch framing, and catcher defense, which are all aspects of baseball that Molina excels at \[citations in paper\].  That being said, a tangible numeric value of the additional Cardinals wins attributable to Molina as a result of these intangible traits has not existed until now.  We caution against generalizing our findings beyond the 2014 season with certainty, but we hope that the point is taken and can be used to strengthen Molina's case for the Hall of Fame.  The point here being that conventional versions of WAR likely have underestimated the number of Cardinals wins attributable to Yadier Molina by a substantial amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

We hope that dWAR can help strengthen Yadier Molina's deserving Hall of Fame case.  **It is entirely within the realm of possibility that conventional calculations of WAR will have underestimated Yadier Molina's career WAR by 10-30 wins when he retires.**

&amp;#x200B;

The 2017 Mike Trout season was truly mind-boggling and it illustrates the collective shortcomings of all metrics, including dWAR.  The dWAR estimator of Mike Trout's value to the 2017 Angels is valid in the sense that the 2017 Angels performed almost as well without Mike Trout as they performed with him.  That is what happened and it is not debatable. However, using this as a final determination of Mike Trout's value is very suspect.  Perhaps the \`\`Mike Trout effect'' is real and perhaps it is a result of either lackadaisical uninspired teammates, poor leadership on Mike Trout's part, poor team management, or all of the above, or possibly some other explanation.  Even if this effect exists, it has only been shown to exist with respect to the 2017 Angels season and it may not exist in any other year or on any other team.  Conventional indirect estimates of WAR provide a one-number summary of how statistically dominant Mike Trout was and currently is.  To what extent this raw context neutral statistical account of Mike Trout's greatness can translate to actual wins above replacement is an honest conversation worth having by fans, historians, scouts, sabermetricians, the baseball media, and team executives alike.

&amp;#x200B;

As it currently stands, dWAR can only validly estimate WAR for a player during a season in which the player spent a substantial time in both the available and unavailable states.  Since the calculation of dWAR is constrained to one season in isolation, it cannot be used to properly compare players across eras for reasons noted in [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc\_challenging\_nostalgia\_and\_performance\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc_challenging_nostalgia_and_performance_metrics/). Valid era-invariant extensions to dWAR for all player seasons can be made with a suitable era-invariant model of the probabilities of team success that are central to the calculation of dWAR.  This is not a trivial task and we speculate that strong structural assumptions in a partially Bayesian latent variable modeling framework would be required to achieve believable era-invariance.  

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to emphasize that traditional considerations of value including leadership ability, winning attitude, clutch performances, great defense, and other intangibles are important supplements to statistical accounts of value.  Our metric dWAR can contribute to this emphasis by measuring to what extent an aggregation of these previously unmeasurable accounts of value has on the additional number of wins a particular player produces for his team over that of a suitable and available replacement player.  If intangible value actually helps a team win when a player is on the field, then dWAR can find it when conventional calculations of WAR such as bWAR, fWAR, and BWARP will not. These conventional calculations of WAR are not actually in the business of directly calculating wins above replacement, dWAR is.

&amp;#x200B;

More of my work can be found here: [https://campuspress.yale.edu/danieleck/research/?preview=true](https://campuspress.yale.edu/danieleck/research/?preview=true)

&amp;#x200B;

Concluding rant: I would like to note that the Yadier Molina Hall of Fame case has a notable skeptic in Mr. Brian Kenney.  In a segment of MLB Now (see here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS4gH9WiEP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS4gH9WiEP0)), Mr. Kenney voices that he does not think that Yadier Molina is a future Hall of Famer and he builds an analytical case against Molina based largely on conventional versions of WAR and OPS+.  I find that his analysis is completely void of any merit. He cherry picks stats that are not suitable for the comparisons that he is making (as noted heavily in my other paper [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc\_challenging\_nostalgia\_and\_performance\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc_challenging_nostalgia_and_performance_metrics/)), and he ignores or minimizes intangible value that is obviously associated with winning games. I hope that dWAR can offer some clarifications that are in favor of the deserving Hall of Fame case for Yadier Molina.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; I am proposing a new estimator of WAR, called dWAR that is capable of directly calculating WAR for players that have a season in which they spend substantial time as an available player and an unavailable player. The dWAR estimator has the potential to yield a much more natural and appropriate estimate of WAR than those which involve the calculation of a hypothetical replacement player via black box methodology.  Take special note that the validity of dWAR depends on the team and the competition faced by the team being similar during both player states.  Very nuanced interpretations of what dWAR measures emerge when team makeup is confounded with the availability of the player in question. ",Sabermetrics

"I'm slowly working thru an idea for a tabletop baseball game that I have. The basic mechanism is 1) draw a card from a deck of 52: Face cards (23%) point to an individual defense card, Red numbered cards (38.5%) point to an individual hitter's card, Black numbered cards (38.5%) point to an individual pitcher's card. Then you roll percentile dice for the outcome from the specific player card.

There will be 14/100 chances 'on average' for a 1B. Right now, I've got 5.39/100 (38.5%) 1Bs coming from the hitter's card, 5.39/100 (38.5%) 1Bs coming from the pitcher's card, and 3.22/100 (23%) 1Bs coming from the defense cards. But I know that pitchers have far less control over the outcome of BIPs than hitters. I don't know how it relates to defense.  So, my question is, who should get 'credit' for the 1B outcomes?

"The past two years I've interned with Major League Baseball teams - affiliate jobs, mostly video and technologies. This was my third year in, I interviewed for probably 18 or so positions, and each and every one I was told I was a finalist, but they didn't give me an offer. I was sought out by teams, I filled out at least 25 questionnaires, and honestly never received anything but positive feedback. 

Anyway, I didn't get a job this season. I understand the field is competitive and I understand you'll hear no more than you hear yes. But, I can't live on a seasonal internship life anymore. To be honest, I spent all my money I saved for years to pursue this, relocate, etc. I don't come from much wealth or excessive privilege. I'm very middle of the road, middle class, and extremely hardworking. But again, I realize that doesn't guarantee you anything.

I have a strong undergraduate business degree and have been working on my Master's. But, I'm on the verge of complete homelessness at the end of this month. I don't know what to do, because this is all I've done since I finished my undergraduate studies.

"TL;DR: Newbie - best practice question about calculating values in SQL before python import, or after python import in dataframe.

Hi all,

Dipping my toes into the world of sabermetrics because 1) I love baseball, and 2) I'd like to practice SQL and Python for data analysis. Apologies in advance if this is a dumb question.

I've always been intrigued by the concept of WAR, and want to have a better understanding of the underlying calculation. I'd like to not simply strip WAR from BaseballReference, and instead calculate it completely from scratch (right now, actual analysis is taking the backseat to skill development). End goal would be to validate my calculation vs. that of official bWAR measures.

Right now my current tools are - 
1. SQL (I imported Lahman's 2016)
2. Python (libraries include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Now, my question... I'm wondering what the best practice is for calculating tons of values/columns that are not inherent to a database in new columns. For example - Lahman's does not contain 1B, which needs to be calculated as H - HR - 3B - 2B. Would it be preferable for me to create a view in SQL that has all the desired values for calculating WAR, or should I simply take the raw data and import to python and calculate these columns in a dataframe? I started this process via the dataframe route, and have found the data cleaning process to be more frustrating than expected..

So I'm trying to do some analysis on the effect of location on team performance. I've looked through the major data sources but haven't had luck finding what I am looking for. The key stats needed are the teams that played (obviously) and the location of the game. I can find the information easily on [MLB.com](https://MLB.com) but it is not in an easily exportable file. I'm also hoping to look at multiple seasons. Does anyone know where I could find this data? Thank you so much!,Sabermetrics
"I'm attempting to create a predictive model for player performance given their current match up using an array of different statistics. I have box score and play by play data for each game over the past 6 seasons and will be utilizing that to calculate each player's stats current to each game they played. It's not too difficult to manually calculate basic stats like AVG and K/9, however more advanced stats like wOBA and wRC+ require a little more effort. Using fangraph's guts page ([https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn](https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn)) is helpful for obtaining each season's weights for calculating stats, but I feel as though it's inadequate for my specific purpose. For instance, if I'm calculating what a player's wOBA was as of June 3, 2015; wouldn't I be utilizing future information if I simply plugged in 2015's linear weights into the wOBA formula? I say this because these weights are calculated using league-wide statistics for the entire 2015 season. I'm curious how a website like Fangraphs or BP would calculate wOBA within each season, given that with each game played the linear weights should slightly change due to the fact that the league's stats are continuously changing. I'm also particularly interested with what they do for the very beginning of the season where simply isn't much information available yet; do they just use the previous season's weights or weigh the early season's weights with the previous season's? I understand this is a little nitpicky and I could probably just use the previous season's weights or general weights, but I'm trying to be thorough with this and would like to do it the right way, if possible. Anyways I'd be very appreciative of any feedback on this topic and look forward to hearing what ideas you guys have!",Sabermetrics
"  

With the first game of Spring Training 2019 hovering a month away, here is a peek at the top prospects from the Seattle and Oakland clubs. I’ve selected one hitter and one pitcher for each team. One of my four picks was ranked No. 1 on mlb.com, but the other three were not – here’s why they should be.

Mariners Prospect Batter: Dom Thompson-Williams.

Thompson-Williams is a power hitter, simply put. His 368 at bats have garnered a .909 OPS for this 23 year old slugger. The early twenties often show an increase in strength, and thus, power. Thompson-Williams has a 25% K avg – he gets a hit 75% of the time. This is a guy to watch out for.

Mariners Prospect Pitcher: Matt Festa.

25-year-old Festa has a low runs allowed average, and get this – 20 saves. He is in the top 4 of Mariners prospects, and for good reason. His ERA sits at 2.67. 

Alright, now for the Athletics. Let’s start with the Prospect Batter: Sean Murphy

Murphy is a 24 year old power hitter who only strikes out every 5.4 at bats. Speaking of the above mentioned potential power that comes with age, Murphy has a .850 OPS.

Finally the Athletics Prospect Pitcher I selected was mlb.com No.1 ranked prospect Jesus Luzardo. I invite you to go on mlb.com and check out why Luzardo is No. 1 along with the prospects for your home team.",Sabermetrics

"In 2015 Cain had a WAR of 7.2 In 2017 he had a WAR of 2015. Reviewing his stats below, it looks like the seasons were pretty comparable. In 2015 he had less games, less hits, 7 more doubles, 1 more triple/HR, 13 more RBIs, so-on... Just eyeballing these stats without knowing a lot about WAR, it seems like the seasons aren't different enough to warrant the value of 2 additional wins on the 2015 season.

So I don't know a ton about baseball so sorry if this is a stupid question.  I've heard both that a pitcher needs more than one pitch to mix seems up so that a batter doesnt know what is coming.  That makes sense.  I've also heard that it just depends on how good the pitch is. Like Mariano rivera would just throw his cutter over and over since nobody could hit it.  So which is it?

"Hey all,

I've been researching and learning about baseball advanced stats for the past few years but recently dove back in again. One thing I've always wondered is about Baseball Prospectus' own advanced stats. I love their site and have read all their books, but it's kind of annoying when they use different stats instead of the near universally recognized wOBA or FIP.

Can anyone explain why they don't use the more widely accepted stats (I know they have equivalent versions, but still) and secondly, is there any merit to using any of their advanced stats over other generally accepted ones? I ask the first question because I've wondered it for years and I ask the second because I haven't followed much baseball in the past two years so I've been out of the loop.

"I'm working on a side project using Baseball Prospectus' [Park Factors](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/index.php?cid=1819112), which give separate values for LHB vs. RHB.

My question is: Do heavy or extreme opposite field hitters exhibit reverse park effects? In other words, when using these L/R split park factors to predict future results, should I treat a LHB with high Oppo% as if they were a RHB and apply the RHB park factor, and vice versa?

It makes sense in my head because:

1. The average hitter pulls balls at a higher % rate than going opposite field or even center.

2. The direction the ball is batted in determines which geometrical features of the park the batted ball interacts with.

3. The geometry of the ballpark is what causes park effects.

But I'm wondering if anyone has looked into this before. I'd love to validate my assumption, but I haven't been able to find any relevant articles online.",Sabermetrics

"For position players, I've noticed that there seem to be a pretty close correlation. fWAR tends to produce a lower total number, but that seems to go league wide in my experience.

One issue I have with fWAR however, is how it seems to undervalue pitchers who generate outs by using weak contact. Marcus Stroman of the Toronto Blue Jays is a great example. On baseball reference he is currently sitting at 4 WAR, and is on pace for around 7.5. That's a number that usually has you in the cy-young conversation.

On fangraphs he is at 1.9 WAR. Not a terrible number, but no where near how valuable baseball reference thinks he is. This is a drastic shift, and makes me wonder what stat people think is better, especially for pitching.

I prefer rWAR because I think it's a mistake to use FIP instead of runs allowed. FIP assumes all contact is random, and fairly equally split between soft, medium, and hard. Runs allowed gives us a better reflection on what is actually happening out on the field. That's my opinion anyway.

If bases are loaded in the bottom of the 9th in a tied game and the batter gets a base hit in deep center, the game ends as soon as the runner on third crosses home plate.

"Okay so I've been working on this individual hitting/pitching baseball statistic since last Summer and I would like to get your opinions on this. Using coefficients from Tango Tiger's ""Run Expectancy Matrix"" that is used for the RE24 and REW statistics, I created a stat that would show the probability that a specific batter will earn his team a run (completely independent, so RBI's aren't included) during his at bat, with base running factored in. The arithmetic certainly looks a little messy, but if you really try to understand it, it can become clear:

((xa + yb + zc)1B + (xd + ye + zf)2B + (xg + yb + zc) 3B+ HR + (xa + yb + zc)BB + ((xd + ye + zf) - (xa + yb + zc))SB -(xa + yb + zc)CS)/(AB + BB)

Baseball Terms: 1B = Singles, 2B = Doubles, 3B = Triples, 
HR = Home Runs, BB = Base on Balls, SB = Stolen Bases, 
CS = Caught Stealing, AB = At Bats
Coefficients: x = .346, y = .332, z = .323, a = .416, b = .265, 
c = .127, d = .614, e = .397, f = .216, g = .843, h = .660,
 i = .247

For convenience, I will be using the acronym IREPA (Independent Runs Earned per At Bat) to define the stat. To test the effectiveness of IREPA, I took a teams total IREPA, then I subtracted the total IREPA that was achieved by opposing teams against them throughout the 2017 season, creating a net IREPA. I then did a linear regression test of teams' total IREPA and team Wins. This yielded a very good R value, .91, which is very similar to regression tests with WAR and WAA against Wins. I would like to do similar regression tests for previous years but as a college student that is too time consuming and I haven't gotten around to it yet. This stat can be used for both batters (IREPA) and pitchers (IREPA Against) but it wouldn't be as useful for pitchers because it is not defense independent. But then again, neither is ERA or WHIP. My goal for this was to create a stat that is easier to understand then WAR, which can be very difficult stat to be understood by casual fans, and make it more accurate then most mainstream stats(RBI, HR, AVG, OBP, SLG) which have big holes in them from an analysis standpoint.

Looking at 2018 potential HOF candidates on BBRef. Saw [Guillermo Mota](http://www.theonion.com/article/mets-acquire-guillermo-mota-from-indians-in-daring-5396) on the list, and noticed he was the 15,047th player to debut. Wondered who the 15,000th player was. (I'm assuming here that the BBRef count of MLB debuts is correct.) Saw that it had to be a player who debuted on [Opening Day* (April 5) 1999](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=1999&amp;month=04&amp;day=5). Except for Williamson (14,999), they're all listed as player #15,000. Here are the candidates: 


Jesse Garcia (BAL) - defensive replacement in 8th inning

Luis Garcia (DET) - defensive replacement in 8th inning

Brett Hinchliffe (SEA) - pitched 6th-9th innings

Masao Kida (DET) - came on to pitch in 8th inning

Onan Masaoka (LAD) -  pitched 7th inning

Kevin McGlinchy (ATL) - came on to pitch in with two out in 7th

Warren Morris (PIT) - started at 2B

Jason Phillips (PIT) - came on to pitch 6th inning (it wasn't good)

Scott Sauerbeck (PIT) - relieved Phillips in 6th inning 

Scott Williamson (CIN) - pitched 9th inning


*there was one game (in Mexico) on April 4, but no new players debuted.


BBRef lists all the games in ET, but I doubt that's correct, as it has the Dodgers playing in LA at 1:14 pm ET, or 10:14 am local time. So I adjusted the start times given (all times ET for comparison):

SF @ CIN: 2:06 pm

DET @ TEX: 2:35 pm

TB @ BAL: 3:10 pm

PHI @ ATL: 4:10 pm

ARI @ LAD: 4:14 pm

MON @ PIT: 7:06 pm

CHW @ SEA: 10:44 pm


Based on this, and how many runs were score in each game, I would guess that Williamson, Luis Garcia, and Masao Kida all entered their games around 5:00 pm ET. Which is to say I'm no closer to figuring out who the actual 15,000th MLB player was.

"I'm trying to extend Nate Silver's [baseball ELO predictions](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-mlb-predictions/) to the league of legends world finals. It's simple enough to calculate the elo of each team, and then use those ratings to project how the tournament will go. 

The problem is that most games are regional, and not all games are taken equally seriously. 


Here's the way a season works: Each of the 4 main regions--North America (NA), Europe (EU), Korea (KR) and China (CN)-- have a spring split and a summer split. There's a mid-season invitational tournament to the top two teams in each region between the spring split and summer split. Then there's the world finals. Each split has it's own playoffs as well. Most people agree that KR is the best region by a good margin, but the rest of the rankings are a little muddier (with CN seeming a bit ahead of the other two). Most people also agree that the world finals is the tournament taken most seriously by the players, and the  mid-season tournament is taken the least seriously. However, the rest of the games are a little unclear. So how do I account for regional strength given that there's not as much data for international play (particularly at the low or mid levels)?


Option 1: I assign every team an elo of 1500 at the start of season 1 and see how the ratings pan out. This has a nice bonus of being simple. However last season, one of the NA teams really beat up on all the local competition and so the elo system thought it was one of the best teams in the world. But since the level of competition in NA is so much lower, the team got knocked out early on. 

Option 2: Use the international play to create the baseline for regional elo. With this method, I first look at international play looking only at the regions. Then after we see the ratings for the average world finals team from each region, I use that to handicap the baselines for last seasons spring and summer splits. This has the advantage of accounting for the fact that some regions are stronger than others, but it mostly accounts for the best of each region, not the worst of each region. That will confuse the spring and summer split stats. 


Option 3: I use a different K parameter for each of spring split, mid-season tournament, summer split, and worlds. I select each K based on what turned out to be the most predictive for last years world finals. I'm leaning towards this but it still requires that I assume that all teams were created equal at the start of season 1 which I think is not a reasonable assumption

I think I have a strong grasp of this notion conceptually. However, I'm having a very difficult time finding research online that explains how much we might want to regress different player statistics towards the mean. I know that there's no true answer to this question, but I'd really like to look at some approaches used by major projection systems and the statistical reasoning behind them. I've tried reading the last chapter of ""The Book"" but I find that they skip too many steps for me to really be confident that I understand where they derive their results from.  

Does anyone have recommended reading I could do about this? I'd really like to avoid ""dumbed down"" explanations and instead I want to get to the statistics behind the results used in practice. 

Thanks!",Sabermetrics

"The title basically says it all. I've searched fangraphs and can't find any articles on it. I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/7h308o/analyzing_statcast_data_to_determine_if_contact/), which basically says pitchers can't control contact but can they control HR/9?

"Suppose I want to rank the top 100 players all-time at first base using WAR. Would I need to discount the years in which a player (say David Ortiz or Frank Thomas) played DH? Or does the positional ""penalty"" they get for being a DH handle that for me? 

What if I am ranking shortstops and Ernie Banks has half his career at first? Should I account for his years at first in some way by discounting his offensive WAR ""earned"" at first base? Or is it sufficient that he didn't get the positional bonus for being a shortstop in those seasons?

One hurdle I am facing is coming up with an ""injury  prone"" variable of sorts. I was thinking that I could take career avg.

"I cannot understand this stat. It seems like it’s often given to a player that didn’t actually produce anything. So how is that helpful or important in determining player development? For instance, game changer shows the top 3 QAB of the game. Two of those spots were filled by the losing team. We won 12-0. The one player on our team with a QAB was 1/2 and the only player without an RBI. Huh? So, the player that was 2/2 with 2 rbi and 2 runs scored had at bats of lesser quality? Huh? How?

This isn’t a one time thing, either. Going through our season so far 19 games, it seems to be the rule rather than the exception.",Sabermetrics
"So Willie Calhoun...I'm not understanding the extreme optimism of what Steamer and Fangraph Depth Charts projects him for. I won't put his full lines but:
Steamer has him for 24 HR, FG for 28, with respective wOBA's of .343 and .345
I'm curious for fantasy purposes, of course...At those projections, Calhoun would be our 10th scoring OF..Scoring about the same as projections for Springer, Cruz, and Benintendi while scoring more than the likes of Ozuna, Yelich, and Judge. 
What am I missing because I usually see prospects get conservative projections but his is anything but. ",Sabermetrics
Does anyone know how I would go about this? I am working with some data that requires a pitchers whole dataset so I cannot just query for specific zones. So does anyone have an idea of how I can back calculate where a pitch lands in the detailed zones with the data given from the statcast csv?

"I'm interested in looking at players' RBI as a percentage of the *total possible* RBI they could have had. For example, if a hitter came up three times with the bases empty in a game and then a fourth time with the bases loaded, he would have a total potential RBI of 7 (himself four times, and the three runners on when he came up with the bases loaded).

The thing is, I'm having trouble finding any of the data you would need to do this without combing through game logs en masse. You could do some rough calculations if you had LOB numbers for an entire season, adding in the player's RBI and number of plate appearances and subtracting the number of home runs. But this wouldn't account for runners on who were moved over but didn't score, and I also can't find LOB numbers for individual players across entire seasons.

"**What is DingerDB?**  
DingerDB is a database populated with MLB data including data points such as players, venues, umpires, games, and even down to each pitch for each game for years 2008 until current day.  (Note that currently 2008 is the earliest data we’ve acquired, but more will be pulled when we have time).  The frontend is an Apache open source data analysis tool called Superset which allows for real time querying of the data along with dashboards that can visualize data.  We have automated the pulling and parsing of data so DingerDB will always remain up to date.

[Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset)

**What is the purpose?**  
- We had the inspiration from retrosheets and the lahman database to try and make something that included current data that had much more granularity than both of those that included modern data such as pitchfx.  We also thought it would be interesting to try and figure out any correlations derived from the verbose data.

**Who we are?**  
- We are a few software engineers who enjoy baseball and have some experience with data processing and indexing so it seemed like a good idea for a side project.  With that said, if there are any features that are requested we will try to accommodate them as best we can if they are possible and our schedules allow for it.

**What do we want?**  
We would like to open DingerDB to a relatively small group of users and collect feedback on performance and usability.

**How do I get access to the data?**

"Ever wonder just how many more home runs heavier players hit than skinnier players? Probably not, but I decided to look at it further.

**Sample**: I included all qualified hitter seasons from 1990 to 2015. 

**Method**: I was interested in home runs as a measure of ""pure power""; as a result, I controlled for the possibility that players who are ""good hitters"" (i.e. higher batter averages) will tend to hit more home runs than those who do not (that is, I did not want to penalize a player for not being good at making contact). As a result, I calculated each player's home runs per hits, instead of something like home runs per AB.

**Results**:
Assuming approximately a league average BA (.265) for each hitter, I found that **each pound is associated with an increase of .21 home runs per season**  (the 95% confidence interval is .195-.224). For example, a 180 pounder is expected to hit 16 home runs per year, while a 220 pounder is at 24 home runs per year.

Some of the data were not valid. For instance, it was almost impossible to figure out the best pound-for-pound individual seasons, because they were dominated by *formerly* skinny players (whose listed weights remained the same across their career, in the Lahman database) who became huge, e.g. Barry Bonds (listed at 185 pounds), Sammy Sosa (165 pounds!), and Brady Anderson (170 pounds). It was quite humorous checking out pictures from players' specific seasons via Google Images. Sorry, 2004 Jose Valentin...you were not 175 pounds.


With that said, here are the pound-for-pound best seasons, filtered to the best of my ability:

**2010 Jose Bautista**: 37 HR over expected (205 pounds; 683 PA; .260 BA; 54 HR)

**1993 Phil Plantier**: 34 HR over expected (175 pounds; 536 PA; .240 BA; 34 HR)

**2009 Carlos Pena**: 33 HR over expected (225 pounds; 570 PA; .227 BA; 39 HR)


And, the worst...

**1998 Dmitri Young**: 27 HR under expected (295 pounds; 590 PA; .310 BA; 14 HR)
**2007 Dmitri Young** came in second place.

**2012 Carlos Lee**: 25 HR under expected (270 pounds; 615 PA; .264 BA; 9 HR)

**2002 Juan Uribe**: 23 HR under expected (245 pounds; 618 PA; .240 BA; 6 HR)

"These are both park- and league- adjusted rate stats that are intended to reflect total offensive contribution for batters per PA. Neither one includes baserunning.

But which is better and why?

It's strange that they view the Boston Red Sox offense so differently. [By wRC+](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2016&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2016&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=16,d), the Red Sox are far and away the #1 offense. But [by Tav](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/index.php?cid=1921660), they are #5, and not particularly close to the top.

They also have fairly wide differences in their measures of the Padres, Braves, Dodgers and Orioles, among others. For the Dodgers, TAv says they are clearly an above-average offense (11th in MLB), whereas wRC+ says they are clearly a below-average offense  (22nd in MLB). How can the two most highly-regarded all-up offensive rate stats be so far apart? And what does it all mean?

Here's grist for the conversation:

From [Baseball Prospectus glossary](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=tav):

&gt; True Average (TAv) is a measure of total offensive value scaled to batting average. Adjustments are made for park and league quality, as such the league-average mark is constant at .260.

&gt; True Average incorporates aspects that other linear weights-based metrics ignore. Reaching base on an error and situational hitting are included; meanwhile, strikeouts and bunts are treated as slightly more and less damaging outs than normal. The baseline for an average player is not meant to portray what a typical player has done, but rather what a typical player would do if given similar opportunities. That means adjustments made for parks and league quality. True Average's adjustments go beyond applying a blanket modifier-players who play more home games than road games will see that reflected in their adjustments. Unlike its predecessor, Equivalent Average, True Average does not consider baserunning or basestealing.


From [Fangraphs glossary](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/what-is-wrc/):

&gt; As you may have noticed, there’s now an extra column in the “Advanced” section for batting stats called “wRC+”. You can think of this stat as a wOBA based version of OPS+. It’s park and league adjusted and it’s on a very similar scale as OPS+. The difference is that it uses wRC, which is based on wOBA.

&gt; For those of you not familiar with the scale, 100 is average. Anything higher is above average and anything below 100 is below average.

&gt; Big thanks goes out to Tangotiger for pointing out how easy it was to implement this particular stat. It’s now available in all the player pages for major league and minor league players going all the way back to 1871. Please note that it is not park adjusted for minor league stats, but it is league adjusted.

"Hi, I'm new to Sabermetrics and the Lahman dataset. When looking at the appearances table, sometimes pitchers (even starters) seem to show 0 for games started.

For instance the 1991 St. Louis Cardinals (SLN), no pitcher has any games started, yet the 1991 SF Giants (SFN) do have pitchers with games started. As you'd expect, the number of games started is usually equal to the games pitched for the starting pitchers.

I have seen this many times and can't figure it out. Any ideas?",Sabermetrics

"Hi all,

I asked this in /r/baseball before I knew /r/Sabermetrics existed, but didn't get many replies. Does anyone know of a source for player projections that dates back to 1996ish? 

I found the [Baseball Projection Project](http://www.bbprojectionproject.com/), and chose the MARCEL projections because they go back far enough. However, they don't have WAR so I went through the painstaking effort of merging the data with some baseball-reference scraping and calculating WAR on my own. 

But, I neglected to check the data before doing so, and upon testing my projection against actual WAR, I found that the MARCELs were quite optimistic (in some cases, projecting strong seasons for players that ended up retiring!). My own simple MARCEL, just taking the last 3 years of WAR and weighting them, performed much better.

I love the Steamer projections -- they're exactly what I need, because they project rookie players as well, but they were built recently (I only could find the last 5 seasons).

Does anyone know of a reliable source for projections dating back to the late 90s/early 2000s? I've already written all the code, so even if it's not in WAR-format, I can probably calculate it.

Edit: I should mention, my version of WAR doesn't include fielding runs or advanced baserunning, just batting runs, wSB, and the positional adjustment. So I'd only need:  PA, AB, 1B, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, CS, BB, SO, IBB, HBP, SF, GIDP.",Sabermetrics

"Hi Everyone,
For the final project in my Applied Statistics Master's Degree Program I had an idea to test how ""The Books Out"" Effect on MLB rookie hitting can predict career longevity.
By ""The Books Out"" I am referring to the fact that a rookie can have an advantage in their first handful of games before the opposition can determine what their strengths and weaknesses are.  After these are determined the rookie is then, usually, at a disadvantage.
I was hoping I could get some pointers on the best way to do this from the Sabermetrics community.
My initial idea was to take the difference of a handful of offensive stats (BA, SO/AB, BB/AB, OBP, SLG, etc.) when ""The Books Out"" from when it is not.
Career longevity will be determined by career ABs.
I was thinking that the 2006 rookie class would be a good year to start since I would then have 9 post rookie years to determine longevity.
On to my questions...
How many ABs would you say it takes for teams to ""write the book"" on a batter?  100?  150?  More?  Less?
What statistics should I focus on to compare pre-""Book"" to post-""Book""?
Where is the best place to gather these stats?  I just came up with this project idea this morning so I haven't done too much digging.  I see that Baseball-Databank.org and Baseball-Reference.com both look like good resources, but I am going to need one that can filter the player rookie stats by pre-""Book"" ABs vs. post-""Book"" ABs.
Any and all comments, questions, additions, critiques are welcome.

Thanks so much.

"Can anyone with insightful knowledge of WAR explain why there exists such a huge difference between the top rated WAR players in the NL vs AL?

1. Mike Trout, 7.2
2. Jose Altuve, 7.0
3. Josh Donaldson, 6.4
4. Mookie Betts, 6.1
5. Manny Machado, 5.6

It may not seem like a huge difference, but the fact the Kris Bryant, first in WAR in NL, wouldn't even crack the top 5 in WAR for AL. I don't know too much about WAR, other than that it gives an insightful measure on a player's value.

Yeah, I've watched that video about luck dragons and the superiority of FIP to ERA, and the idea that pitchers have apparently no control over balls hit in play.

So I'll just give you a scenario similar to a game I watched today. In the mid innings of a close game, a pitcher gives up three hits, maybe two singles and a double, in a row. According to FIP and Sabermetrics, though, he hasn't done anything wrong, since the balls in play are all on luck and the fielders. So if the manager pulls the pitcher, is he wrong? Would it make no difference if he gave up four or five hits in a row on balls in play, or is there some point at which it would be reasonable to say, ""The current pitcher is, at this point, not pitching very well and needs to be taken out of the game""?",Sabermetrics

He claimed that the 2014 and 2015 Royals were THE anti Three True Outcome team, which is why they spanked everyone for two years, and had it not been for Madison Bumgarner being in god mode, they would have beaten the Giants in 2014.

For example, if this player has a BABIP of .375 and has put seven balls in play that have corresponding expected BAs, according to similar balls in play based on launch angle and exit velo, of say; .040, .090, .255, .260, .333, .560, and .850.

"I'm a baseball guy working on a soccer project. I'm trying to translate ERA- and PF to soccer statistics, but I'm running into an odd calculation problem.

I'm using a customized baseball park factor as a soccer league factor to compare players across two leagues, and a customized ERA- stat for a soccer rate stat (i.e. percentage) for the player and league average in the calculation. See the variables below:

w = Player A Rate: 52.38%
x = League A Average Rate: 33.32%
y = League B Average Rate: 14.42%
z = League Factor: 230

According to [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/era-fip-xfip/), the formula for ERA- is:
100 * ((w + (w – w*(z/100)))/ x)

Since a better ERA is a lower stat, and a lower ERA- indicates a better ERA relative to league average, Player A's anticipated ERA- should be exceedingly high since its above the League A average and the League B average adjusted for the League Factor. However, the final calculation is -47.29. Is this just a flaw in the stat when the League/Park Factor gets so big that the subtracted product of (w*(z/100)) is larger than (2w)? Or am I doing something wrong?

This is the only stat in the only league where this is a problem, out of 14 leagues and 35 stats. The other league factors all range (much more reasonably) between 60 and 134, and don't experience this problem.

I finally got around and started brainstroming about the structure about my thesis. My main focus is to use mathematical tools adequate to a college Maths student and make the baseball part easily understandable to people, who have little knowledge about Sabermetrics.  
My idea is to create a simple win prediction model, which is dependent only on runs scored and runs allowed. Here is how I would like to proceed:  
1. Predict runs scored using Markov chains inspired by ""A Markov chain approach to baseball"" by Bukiet, Harold, Palacios.  
2. Predict runs allowed by using team ERA. Here I am not sure how to predict it correctly. Any ideas?

"Hello again sabermetricians!  
I am really sorry to be posting another kind of off topic here(it is the last one, I swear), but this time I have a specific idea how I would like to write my paper. Because my professor responded nearly after a week since I first wrote to him, I took the time and did a course on edX.org Sabermetrics 101. So i had a chance to have a peek into certain parts of Sabermetrics, even as brief as they were.  
The part which appeared the most interesting to me was about win predicting, win estimators, run differentials, runs to wins, etc. And my idea is to use data from our national league and:  
1. Try to explain why this season ended up the it did. Do a kind of post-prediction, create my own prediction, acting like I don't know the results and then compare my predictions with the real season ending.  
2. Do a prediction for year 2017.  
  
Few notes: Our national league has got 8 teams and the first league 10. So I would probably take all 18 teams and then draw a line under the 8th team. I don't want to deal with playoffs or playouts, just standard season.  
The main problem I see in my idea is number of games played. There are 35 rounds in National league and 18-30 (each year it is different) in the first league, which compared to MBL is awful low number. I am not sure this will be enough to get a solid result. If the number of games should not be sufficient I would return my research to MLB, I guess it wouldn't make such a difference for me.  
Now I would like to kindly ask for your advice or opinions or suggestions on literature. Again I would like to state I won't be able to make very accurate predictions, I just want to do something fun and complete my assignment, even if it's recycling already used methods. So any help is appreciated, thanks!",Sabermetrics

Doing a population and demographics paper here on MLB drafted players. Currently, it has came down to evaluating around 6000 players who has had a WAR accumulation at the MLB level.

What do you all see as the best indicator for the amount of playing time that a player gets? I currently have data on AB, Games, career length. I would really appreciated if any of you could elaborate your reasoning. 

As part of linear model that I am evaluating, currently, I am finding that HS/College and round drafted has a significant effect on WAR through a intervening variable Games played. Games played also has a significant correlation with WAR accumulated.

"I'm a big fan of wOBA and the improvements it makes on traditional stats by factoring in the relative run value of different types of hits. I was wondering if there was a similar statistic that measures a player's offensive production with runners on base, and similarly makes those adjustments based on where runners are on base. Hitting a double with someone on first could easily score that runner, while hitting a single may not.

In general I am not a fan of ""high leverage"" type statistics just because the sample sizes can be so small that the stats are near meaningless. I haven't seen any good proof that someone who is ""clutch"" one year will repeat that over time. And I'm more interested in using stats to predict performance, rather than using it for purely reporting purposes. But if we expand the high-leverage idea to encompass every scenario where a batter comes up with runners on any base, then the sample size may grow big enough to be useful.

"I saw in a different thread TangoTiger explaining how to convert wOBA into Runs Per 9:


&gt; At a team level, the simplest way to convert wOBA relative to league average into runs relative to league average is to square it. So, a team .360 wOBA in a league of .327 would be 1.1 squared, or 1.21 runs relative to league average. If league average is 4.5, then this means 4.5x1.21 = 5.45 runs per game.
You just need to know what the league average wOBA and runs per game is.

"I've read numerous articles about regression models in baseball, but am having a tough time creating one for myself. I don't have a specific topic in mind right now, but if anyone knows a good place that offers a class or walkthrough (edX?) on how to start creating linear regression models that would be great. 

Any help/insight is appreciated. Baseball specific regression articles/classes are definitely a plus.",Sabermetrics
"EDIT--title isn't quite correct. For very good pitchers, a high BABIP can cause an overly optimistic FIP, while for poor pitchers, a low BABIP can cause an overly optimistic FIP.



As you may know, the formula for FIP is:

* **FIP**= ((13(HR)+3(BB+HBP)-2(K))/IP) + FIP constant


xFIP is essentially the same, except the HR total is calculated by looking at the pitcher's FB rate and the league average HR/FB%.


Obviously, what these metrics do is estimate a pitcher's performance based solely on Ks, BBs, and HR--that is, they essentially eliminate any consideration of hits and balls in play, in an effort to eliminate random variance in ERA due to luck on balls in play. By eliminating these factors from consideration and instead focusing solely on non-ball-in-play outcomes, FIP and xFIP assume a pitcher will allow a league average BABIP.


This makes sense: When it comes to pitchers, we know that a good portion of the variation in BABIP is due to luck. And conversely, variation in Ks and BBs is purely a product of a pitcher's relative ability. 


Or is it? Obviously, a pitcher's skill is the biggest cause of K and BB variation, but if a pitcher doesn't face any batters, he can't strike anyone out or walk anyone! To illustrate, consider the following example:


* Pitcher A has been unlucky -- he's given up a .350 BABIP across 118.2 in innings while striking out 125, walking 25, and giving up 10 HR


* Pitcher B, on the other hand, has been lucky -- he's given up only a .250 BABIP across 126.2 innings while also striking out 125, walking 25, and giving up 10 HR


Now, assuming (solely for simplicity's sake; it doesn't affect the analysis) that neither of these pitchers have gotten any outs by drawing double plays or catching stealers or pickoffs, etc, they've each faced exactly 500 batters. Accordingly, they both have identical 25% K-rates and 5% BB-rates. 


Essentially, the only difference between these two pitchers is their batted ball luck. But FIP eliminates batted ball luck from its evaluation of a pitcher, so these guys should have identical FIPs, right? Actually, wrong. Here, pitcher A--the one who had the extremely high BABIP--has a 2.72 FIP. Pitcher B , who had a .250 BABIP, has a 2.74 FIP.


Now, I know these differences in my hypothetical are basically negligible, but the point remains the same--using raw K and BB numbers can skew value between guys with high and low BABIPs. This is even more troublesome given the fact that when 2 pitchers have a 100 point gap in their BABIP through 100+ innings each, we can probably assume that *some* portion of that gap isn't mere luck. But, as demonstrated, FIP can actually place *positive* value on a high BABIP. 



As for the smallness of the difference in my hypo, I'll point out that I just picked random easy numbers numbers without putting any thought whatsoever into the type of numbers that would better emphasize my point. As I crunched the numbers, I came to realize that, essentially, the better the pitcher (i.e. the higher his K%, the and lower his BB% and number of HR given up), and the more unlucky his BABIP (relative to a pitcher with identical FIP components), the bigger the difference would be. (Low HR and BB and high K makes the number added to the FIP constant more negative). This works in the opposite direction for non-top end pitchers (i.e., pitchers whose (13(HR)+3(BB)-2(K)) calculation is a positive).



So, all that said, why are we using raw K/BB numbers????",Sabermetrics

"Hi guys!

First time poster here, so let me know if this question is in the wrong place, or if there's a way I can find this info myself.

I'm wondering if there is a way to accurately compare a pitcher from the early 1900s to one in the modern era. You can compare WHIP or xFIP all day, but the dead-ball pitchers had a decided advantage thanks to not having to replace used baseballs, etc. Does anyone have a way to address this issue, or is the problem too multi-faceted and non-specific?

Basically, I want to compare Babe Ruth's pitching ability to those of modern pitchers.

I'm thinking that I could look at league-average xFIP (and other pitching stats) from 1915-1919 (Ruth's primary pitching years) and then do the same for pitchers in the modern era. Then I could say ""Ruth was in the top x percentile of pitchers in his era. The pitchers in in that percentile today are pitchers a b and c.""

"Hope you guys don't mind something not 100% baseball, but how and to what degree do you think the linear weights would change?

A weak team team would have an OBP of .490, 2% HRs, 3% 3bs, 8% 2bs, 5% BBs, and I'm not sure about SAC flies (probably a lower rate).

"I was taking a look at some of the pitch f/x stuff on Fangraphs, and I'm wondering if there's anything to be learned from pitcher vs hitter matchups. For example, whether a ""fastball hitter"" has an advantage against ""fastball pitchers"". But I'm not sure the best way to look at it. Are there figures for what qualifies as a ""fastball pitcher""?

But even if a pitcher likes to throw his fastball a lot, if he's up against a fastball hitter, maybe he'll resort to other pitches instead? Maybe this changes depending on how good their own fastball actually is? Just kind of brainstorming here.

"For example, the White Sox. Chris Sale is wonderfully brilliant but there's not much of a team around him.

I feel the Ace+Scrubs would be more valuable to a team with a poor offense because you're at least likely to win on Ace Day, while Five Guys rotation would be more valuable to a team with a high offense because you just need to keep it close enough for the offense to mash.

Team A beats Team B, Team B beats Team C, so we assume Team A can beat Team C?  (and his hence more deserving of a title). Even if we ignore the issue of close calls, where Team A beat Team B by getting some lucky plays in, it seems possible Team B might have some weaknesses that Team A was able to exploit which Team C might not have (i.e. it's possible Team C could beat A). 

Is this a problem that has been addressed empirically in playoff sports? Do we know that most of the time this assumption of transitivity is a good assumption?

"It's my understanding that things like FIP aim to show how well a pitcher *actually* performed by controlling for factors outside of their control. I also know that there are season-long projections on sites like Fangraphs that aim to project performance. I'm wondering if there is a way to compare what a pitcher has done vs what they are expected to do. Kind of like ""so far in 2015 Kershaw has had a FIP of 2.82, and he's projected for a FIP of 2.41, so he's been performing at 85% of his expected output.""

The question comes to comparing stats like FIP or SIERA to projection models like ZiPS. ZiPS doesn't project SIERA. And in a way, that makes sense. Advanced stats aim to remove randomness and luck, so a projection can't accurately predict someone being unlucky. So in a way, projecting someone to be unlucky is kind of meaningless. In that case, is it valid to compare projected ERA and previous FIP? Basically, a projected traditional stat with a calculated advanced stat, for the purposes of creating a personal baseline for a player?

For now, let's ignore whether the results would be meaningful in anyway (considering sample size and projection accuracy and whatnot). I'm more interested if the logic is sound. ",Sabermetrics
"This is mostly a general question, so it can apply to either pitching or hitting. But when looking at a player during, say, the past 3 days, is there a good way to figure out how ""locked in"" they are? I've been looking at wRC+, and it feels like it doesn't really account for variance. For example, a player could go 0-3, 2-3 (with a HR), and 0-3 on three consecutive nights, and still have a huge wRC+ for that period. Basically it gets inflated by a HR. Where as a player that goes 2-3, 1-3, 2-3 with all singles gets penalized because they're ""just"" singles, despite the fact that he would appear to be more ""locked in"".

My only thought would be to look at something like BABIP, since player 1 would likely have a low BABIP vs high for player 2. But I've also read that BABIP can take a while to stabilize.

Any thoughts?",Sabermetrics

"My question is multifacted and kind of convoluted because I'm just starting to toy with advanced metrics so if anyone needs any clarification please feel free to let me know..

So I'm currently looking at the 2014 season, my goal being to find out which players benefited the most from one aspect of their game (hitting, defense, baserunning). To this end I'm trying to figure out what percentage of their fWAR was made up of each component - for example, trying to isolate the player for whom their Wins Above Replacement was most prominently made up of Baserunning. 

What I've done is multiplied WAR by runs/win to get the raw sum (Baserunning+Batting+Fielding+Positional Adjustment+League Adjustment+Replacement Runs) and taken the percentages of baserunning, batting, and fielding. This would give me the percentage of the sum taken up by each component of WAR. 

This works well for the most part, but I do run into some issues that mess with the data - negative values, for example, which makes using percentages problematic because it's difficult to figure out what portion of a sum is contributed to by a negative value ([such as with Jean Segura here](http://i.gyazo.com/db547436ac93792c2d16f985d7ce0358.png)). If a player ends up with a negative WAR*(runs per win) value, or a value of &lt;1, then the percentages column just ends up with ridiculous numbers that I don't really know how to deal with.

Secondary question - my replacement runs column was taken from FanGraphs so I know it's good data but why is it that there are different values for each player? Shouldn't every Replacement Runs value for every shortstop be the same?

I get the sense that I'm approaching the problem the wrong way, and if I'm on the right track and there is a way to smooth out the kinks in my methodology then I sure would like to know.

"exOUT%

In the early 21st century, Oakland Athletics’ General Manager Billy Beane revolutionized baseball forever. He was the first general manager in baseball to heavily utilize sabermetrics in his baseball operations. This isn’t a history lesson though, I bring him up because of his idea that outs are precious, and as a hitter your goal is to not make out, thus him prioritizing OBP so heavily. In the following years, baseball statistics have seen phenomenal progress on both offense and for pitchers. While I believe FIP and xFIP are both very useful statistics in really measuring a pitcher’s skill, my problem is that they essentially ignore all the batted ball data that we have (GB%, FB%, LD%). SIERA and tERA have solved some of these problems, but are far from perfect, and I believe the more statistics we have, the better. 

As I mentioned with Beane, while we largely focus on a hitter’s ability to not make out, we still don’t have a catch-all statistic to realize how effective pitchers are at getting batters, because if the batter’s goal is to not make out, the pitcher’s goal is to get the batter out. So I present to you expected out percentage, or exOUT% (the name is certainly a work in progress). exOUT% sets out to answer a simple question: For any plate appearance, what is the likelihood that the pitcher will get the batter out? This can easily be found by just looking at a pitcher’s opponent OBP, but that is rather primitive, and we can get a better estimate by focusing more on pitchers’ skills to strike people out, not walk batters, and the type of contact they are giving up, and also trying to negate the effect of the defense by him, by just using league averages. So to calculate a pitcher’s exOUT%, I used K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, FB%, lFFB%, and 2014 league averages on ground balls, line drives, and fly outs. (HBPs are essentially ignored but can certainly be incorporated in a future version, this is pretty exOUT% v .01)

 I want to give full disclosure, I am not a statistician or close to it. Math and statistics are an area of interest and I am currently pursuing a degree in math-economics, but I am far from a professional, so I recognize there are going to be errors in my data, this is an extremely rough version, there’s even a combination of data from this year and last year so there will be inconsistencies, as I don’t have the resources to gather all the data I need. If after reading this, you are interested in this and would like to take this further, please feel free to contact me if you have the skills necessary to advance this further (or even if you don’t). 

 I will first post a simple step-by-step breakdown of how to calculate exOUT%, and then get into more detail and take you through it with Clayton Kershaw, because well, he is awesome.

1- Add K% and BB%, subtract this percentage from 100%, this leaves you with a balls in play%, let’s just say BIP%

2- Multiply the pitchers GB% (make the percentage a number less than 1, for example 40% is .4) and BIP% (leave it between 1 and 100, ex 40%), this gives you a GB% for all PAs, not just balls in play, we’ll call this overall GB%, or oGB%… now multiply this percentage (in between 1 and 100) times the league average percentage of ground balls that don’t go for hits (league average is .239 on ground balls in 2014, so out percentage on ground balls is 76.1%, but make it .761…. this will give you a percentage you can leave between 1 and 100, if the number is 20%, that means that there’s a 20% chance that pitcher will induce a ground ball out that PA, assuming league average defense, we can assume this because we’re using the league average for batting average on groundballs… we’ll call this exgbOUT%

3- Now follow the same steps but with LD%, exldOUT%, the percentage chance for any given PA that the pitcher will produce a line drive out. (the league average on line drives last season was .685 (!) so that means there is a 31.5% chance a line drive will result in an out)

4- Same thing with FB%, sort of, because we also want to incorporate IFFB%. So multiply a pitcher’s FB% by their IFFB%, this gives you the percentage of balls in play that the pitcher produces an infield fly ball (bipIFFB%). Multiply this percentage by their BIP% to get his overall percentage of PAs that result in an infield fly, and this will also be their exiffbOUT%, because any infield fly ball should be converted to an out, and if not, it’s to no fault of the picture, so we won’t punish him. Next subtract a pitcher’s IFFB% from 1 or 100, whatever, and this is their balls in play percentage of fly balls that are normal fly balls, to the outfield. Multiply this number by their BIP%, this gives you the overall normal FB% for a pitcher, not just balls in play. Multiply this number by .793 (the league average on fly balls in is .207, so there’s a 79.3% that a fly ball will result in an out). This number is the percentage chance that for any given PA, the pitcher will produce a fly ball out to the outfield. Add this exnfbOUT% (n for normal) and his exiffbOUT% and you have his exfbOUT%, the percentage that for any given PA, the pitcher will produce a flyball out, to the infield or outfield.

5- Add K% + exgbOUT + exldOUT + exfbOUT

6- You have your exOUT%

The terms are not that technical or scientific so I don’t confuse anyone, tried to simply a very complicated procedure as much as possible. To clarify and give you an example, let’s go through Clayton Kershaw

Kershaw profiles like this (I compiled this data on 8/21): 32.3 K%, 4.9 BB%, 52.8 GB%, 26 FB%, 11.8 IFFB%, 21.2 LD%. 

So let’s look at the balls that don’t go in play, strikeouts and walks. Add the two and balls not in play percentage is 37.2, 4.9% are walks and thus won’t be an out, and 32.3% are strikeouts so will be an out. Thus far, Kershaw’s exOUT% is 32.3 (of a possible 37.2 so far)

Now let’s look at the balls in play. People will usually say that a pitcher can’t control what happens when a ball is in play, but I vehemently disagree, the type of contact the pitcher gives up can’t be ignored and large effects what will happen to the ball in play. I will quote a fangraphs article here to explain it, “Generally speaking, line drives go for hits most often, ground balls go for hits more often than fly balls, and fly balls are more productive than ground balls when they do go for hits (i.e. extra base hits). Additionally, infield fly balls are essentially strikeouts and almost never result in hits or runner advancement.” And fangraphs also gives us this data from 2014.

GB: AVG- .239, ISO- .020, wOBA- .220

LD: AVG- .685, ISO- 190, wOBA- .684

FB: AVG- .207, ISO- .378, wOBA- .335

So this means that fly ball pitchers are most likely to get outs, although they may be less effective because when they don’t get outs, it’s more trouble than ground ball pitchers. But remember, this statistic is just finding the chance that the pitcher will get a hitter out.

Alright so let’s calculate Kershaw’s exgbOUT%, exldOUT%, and exfbOUT%, you can follow the numbers along with the steps I listed above. 

GB%- 52.8

62.8 x .528 = 33.1584

(33.1584 x .761)=  25.23354424 exgbOUT


LD%- 21.2

62.8 x .212 = 13.3136

(13.3136 x .315) = 4.193784 exldOUT


FB%- 26

26 x .118= 3.068 bipIFFB%

26 x .882= 22.932 (bipFB%) 

62.8 x .22932= 14.401296 (onFB%)

14.401296 x .791= 11.3914251 exnfbOUT%

62.8 x .03068= 1.926704 oIFFB% and exiffbOUT%

exnfbOUT% + exiffbOUT% = 13.3469317 exfbOUT%, if you followed my math exactly a decimal may be off, like 13.31 something, but this is the number the excel doc chugged out, so I’m trusting that, my iPhone calculator can’t carry all the decimals sometimes.

Now add them all up

32.3 + 25.23354424 + 4.193784 + 1.926704  + 11.3914251 = 75.07% 

K% + exgbOUT% +  exldOUT% + exiffbOUT% + exnfbOUT% = exOUT%

The league average exOUT%, using league average statistics from 2014 for the ones involved, is 69.8%. Scherzer leads the majors (well the 89 pitchers I was able to export data from fangraphs) with a 76.43 exOUT%, if you want to look at it as a more concise and better version of opponent OBP, his is .236, so, you know, good. Here is a picture of the data,(http://imgur.com/um42PkI)  for the top 37, the J column is what you are looking at, Betances is in their because I wanted to calculate one reliever. 

Alright, I’ve explained it a bit in the prologue, but now that you’ve seen it, let me explain more why I like this stat. Well first, I created it and calculated, so, well, yeah… but I also like this stat because it answers a very simple question “How good is a pitcher at getting people out?” Pitching in its simplest form, is exactly that, getting people out. The stat recognizes that there’s basically only these outcomes for an at bat: strikeout, walk, ground ball, line drive, fly out and looks at the pitcher’s stats in these categories to determine how many people he should be getting out. The stat is more predictive than evaluative in nature, because you can calculate a pitcher’s actual out percentage, but that doesn’t nearly tell the whole story, because a lot of luck is involved with balls in play, and other fluky outcomes. This operates under the basis that a ground ball will perform the way the average ground ball does, a line drive performs the way an average line drive does, and a fly ball behaves the way a typical fly ball does. There could be guys getting very fortunate with ground balls: having a great infield behind them, balls not squeaking through the holes; with line drives: being hit right at people; and fly balls: staying in the park, having outfielders who cover a lot of ground. And there could be guys who are getting unlucky: the ground balls are getting through the holes, the infielders don’t have range; line drives seem like they are always going for hits, and fly balls are falling in. This says that a pitcher can’t control that, but they can control how much they strike out people, how much they walk people, and how often they give up ground balls, line drives, and fly balls, and if these balls in play behaved the way they should, the pitcher should be getting this percentage of people out. 

I will address the flaws I have found with it. As much as getting people out is important, sometimes what happens in the plate appearances that don’t end in outs are almost as important. This only deals in average regarding balls in play, but wOBA is very important too. Fly balls are more likely to be outs than ground balls, but the wOBA on fly balls is over 100 points higher on fly balls too. Additionally, I’d prefer instead of ground balls, line drives, fly balls, to use soft contact, medium contact, hard contact, because that is a truer test of pitcher skill, however, I did not have this data at my disposal as far league averages on what the batting average is for soft contact, medium contact, hard contact (if someone does, please contact me like I said). So what I have for now will do and this batted ball data is still a good measure. I sat out to calculate what percentage of batters a pitcher should be getting out, and that is exactly what I found out. So while it’s not perfect, it has it’s use, and it’s something to build on

exRP27

And build on I did, while the out percentage is nice, it doesn’t give us a measure like ERA or FIP or xFIP, that tells us how many runs a pitcher should be giving up. So using the data I used to calculate exOUT%, I present to you exRP27 (expected runs per 27 outs, a stupid name for a hopefully not stupid stat). 

The basis for this stat is this data from fangraphs, “Line drives are death to pitchers, while ground balls are the best for a pitcher. In numerical terms, line drives produce 1.26 runs/out, fly balls produce 0.13 R/O, and ground balls produce only 0.05 R/O.” *(I don’t know how this was calculated, or when it is accurate for, but this is what I got). We don’t know this for soft contact, medium contact, hard contact, so again I’m sticking with ground balls, line drives, and fly balls. 

Alright so what I am going to do using this stat and the pitcher’s K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, and FB% is seeing how many runs the pitcher should be allowing over 27 outs, and then adjust it to get it on a scale similar to ERA, FIP, and xFIP. 

Keeping Clayton Kershaw as our example, let’s take a look

Kershaws K% is 32.3, we’re multiplying this by 27 (for outs in a game), and we get 8.721 K’s, so 0 runs so far because a K will never produce a run

Now GB%. His exgbOUT% is 25.23354424, multiply this by 27 and we get 6.8 (ish, final number will be exact via the excel doc). Multiply this by .05 (the runs per GB out he gets) and we get .34 runs.

LD%- his exldOUT% is 4.193784, multiply by 27 and get 1.13232168, and multiply this by 1.26 for LD runs/out and we get 1.43 runs

His exfbOUT% is 13.3181291, now multiply by 27 get 3.6 and then that by .13 and you get .47 runs

Add up all these exRUNS and Kershaw’s total is 2.24. However, we can’t stop here because the number of outs he’s recorded is only 20.3 (8.7+6.8+1.1+3.6) approximately. 20.3 is the rounded up total. So get this 20.3 (or whatever the pitcher’s exOUTS is) up to 27  by multiplying by whatever it takes, and then multiply his exRUNS by this same number. For Kershaw you end up with 2.97 exRP27unofficial. The league average would be 3.78. Last year’s average ERA/FIP/xFIP was 3.74, but when I adjust everything to that, everyone’s exRP27 just goes down slightly (Kershaw’s from 2.97 to 2.94), but I want it to be on a more realistic scale where everyone’s totals are lower and a really good exRP27 is comparable to a really good FIP, like in the low 2s. 

So I don’t what the statistics correct way is, but here is what I did to make it work. I calculated what his “ERA” would be using by multiplying his exRUNS by 9 and then dividing that by his exOUTS. His was .99, the league average was 1.26. I then did .99/1.26 to get .78 or so, I then multiplied that by his exRP27unofficial and got 2.34, I felt like this was more realistic and in line with his ERA/FIP/xFIP. Obviously, can’t be the same because they measure different things, but just got in in the area. And the same is done for all pitchers obviously, not everyone gets multiplied by .78 of course. 

Here is the leaderboard for that (S column), you will need to zoom in. http://imgur.com/1AvTDiG

I really like this stat a lot, and feel like it does what I wanted to accomplish, figure out how many runs a pitcher should allow per 27 outs given his K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, FB%, and the notion that balls in play will behave the way they normally, as anything else is likely luck and not indicative of the pitcher’s performance. 

I look at Sonny Gray as someone this stat is perfect for. His ERA is outstanding at 2.04, but his FIP is 3.00, his xFIP is 3.47 and his SIERA is 3.50. The problem is, at least with FIP and xFIP for sure is that they ignore what happens when the ball is in play. He doesn’t strike out too many people, he has a good BB% but not spectacular, and he’s given up 10 home runs, a fair amount, so this hurts his FIP and what not. However, instead of saying “well he will regress, look at his FIP/xFIP/SIERA” this looks at why he’s having this success, and it has to do with the balls in play, which is getting ignored. Gray’s LD% is just 14.6! That is really good! Second best of the 90 pitchers I did this for. And his GB% is 54%, 9th best, also really good. The pitcher does have control over the type of contact he allows, and the fact that Gray is producing a ton of ground balls, and very few line drives is why he’s been so successful. His 2.34 exRP27 suggests that he has not been as good as his 2.04 ERA suggests, but he’s not as far off as the other stats suggest. 

Obviously exRP27 is far from perfect, and is in no way supposed to replace FIP/xFIP/SIERA, but it is something to look at with them. I am a big believes in aggregation, so I think that averaging some combination of these 4 stats together or them all, is an even better way to evaluate a pitcher. We’ve got more data than ever, so it makes sense to use it, exRP27 and exOUT% are just more examples of utilizing this data to help better evaluate pitchers.  

I hope you guys enjoyed. Any feedback please comment or contact me. Next I will be looking at exWOBA against for pitchers using similar data, and exWOBA for batters using the data but for hitters.

------------

TL;DR

the first stat is exOUT%, or the probability that a pitcher, given league average defense and a random batter, will get the hitter out, using his K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, and FB%

The second stat is exRP27, basically parlays that data into an ERA like stat, or runs expected per 27 outs

"In r/videos - someone posted this video of an 18 pitch at bat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4JuBmzjNsE

Which got me thinking about the value of wearing out a pitcher. What is the value of this?

What would the value of someone who never got a hit, either always struck out or walked be? Let's say, a player always eventually struck out, but it took the pitcher X amount of pitches to strike the batter out. How big does X have to be for you to want this person on your team? 

Could you be considered the best batter in history if you never got a hit, but walked at a sufficiently high rate? How good would your walk rate/pitch count rate have to be before teams would intentionally walk you every time?

"Okay, amateur statistics guy here, and I was doing some number compiling here, and I put together some numbers, and I think my conclusion holds up. Tell me what you think:
 
The Toronto Blue Jays are sitting at 57-52 (for a .523 winning percentage), five games over .500, and in second place to the surprise Yankees in the AL East by four and a half games. They're by most accounts having a fine season, and their activity leading up to last week's non-waiver trade deadline definitely can't hurt their postseason outlook. (On a side note, they're currently at 69.1% odds to make the Postseason, 21.3% to win the division.)
 
The Oakland Athletics are a bit worse off: they sit at 48-61 (.444), a whopping thirteen games under .500, and sit in the cellar of the AL West just behind the Seattle Mariners (a team I picked as a Wild Card team in Spring Training - oops) and 12 games out from the even-more-surprising-Houston Astros. The A's, by all accounts, are having a bummer of a season.
 
But I was compiling some statistics concerning runs scored and runs given up for the season (which is totally something a normal person does), and one thing stuck out at me: the Toronto Blue Jays and the Oakland Athletics are underperforming.
 
The Pythagorean Win Theorem is a creation of Bill James that relates the number of runs scored and runs allowed to a team's actual win percentage; this is based on the idea that a team's runs scored and runs allowed is a better indication of its future performance than its actual ""real"" win percentage is.
 
Before Wednesday's games, the Bluebirds from The Great White North have scored 578 runs while giving up 464 runs, for MLB's best run differential at 114. (Side Note Two: my St. Louis Cardinals are at #2, three runs behind at 110.) If you plug these numbers into James' Pythagorean theorem formula (using 1.81 as the exponent), it results in a Pythagorean Record of 65-44, a winning percentage of .596.
 
The Moneyballers, for their part, have scored 449 runs while giving up 417, for the Major's eleventh-best run differential of 32. If you plug these numbers into James' formula, again using 1.81 as the exponent, it yields a Pythagorean record of 58-51, a winning percentage of .532.
 
The Jays are eight games below what their Pythagorean record forecasts, the A's ten. For the record, no other team is more than five games off their Pythagorean win total, which pretty close to normal for this test. Through 2013, the average difference between the Actual and the Expected W-L is a bit more than 3 games at the end of a season, although there are exceptions (such as the 2005 and 2007 Arizona Diamondbacks, who beat their expected W-L by 11 games, as did the 2005 Baltimore Orioles).
 
Now, this isn't to say that the Blue Jays should be at 65 wins, or the A's should be at 58 wins. It's merely a rough estimate of what their ending winning percentage likely will be, given their runs scored vs runs allowed numbers stay where they are. They could suffer injuries in their rotations, or in their lineups, or the Coliseum could finally burn down, fall over, and sink into the San Leandro Bay, or any other number of big, bad things can happen. However, in the AL East, where the top four teams are separated by 5.5 games - and second through fourth by just a single game - eight wins can make a big difference. In the case of the AL West, the difference of 10 games puts the A's in second place - a mere two games out of the division-leading Astros. For fans of these teams, imagining where the teams might be - or could be in two months' time - can be maddening, especially for Oakland fans; the A's playoff odds currently sit at 0.6%.

This led me to wonder: why are these two teams so far under their expected W-L record? One culprit seems like it could be their records in one-run games. The Blue Jays have participated in 34 contests decided by a single run, with an 11-23 record, good for a .324 winning percentage. That’s horrendous, considering their .523 actual win percentage and their .596 Pythagorean win percentage. Just competing at their real percentage, their record would be 18-16, good for 7 of those 9 wins they’re missing, a record of 64-45, and a two and a half game lead in the division. Go by their Pythagorean win percentage, and you’re looking at a 20-14 record in one-run games, and a 65-43 record, and first place in the AL East by four and a half games.
 
The A’s have participated in 36 one-run games, and are a similarly abysmal 11-25, good for a .306 win percentage. Going by their .440 actual win percentage, and they would be 16-20 in one-run games. At 5 more wins, this isn’t earth-shattering, but it’s enough to get them to 53-56, 7 games out (and out of the cellar) of the AL West. Use their Pythagorean win percentage – .532 – and the A’s are at 19-15 in one-run games, good enough for a 56-53 record, only 4 games out of the division lead.",Sabermetrics

"Back again with another question, hopefully one worth doing our senior project about. After speaking to a couple college pitchers and one minor league, an idea that seemed to follow was looking to see if pitching at Coors field is actually affected by the high altitude.

 There are a few articles about the physics aspect, but no real stat heavy ones I've found. Basically we would be comparing the outcome of a pitch at Coors vs at some sea level stadium. Because based on the physics, the ball shouldn't break as much at high altitude, so hypothetically the same pitch could be thrown and end up being too high when it's usually a strike. A couple players mentioned you throw more sinker ball pitches in Colorado, so one think we would test is to see if there really is a higher frequency of these pitches being thrown.

**However**, his 2015 UZR was a miserable [-3.9](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11899&amp;position=OF). Can you guys help me understand this? Is it just a case of selective memory? Because I swear the kid has [invisible wings](http://m.mlb.com/video/v75595983/sealad-pederson-makes-a-marvelous-catch-in-center/?game_pk=413780), and just look at [this throw](http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/6479266/v75694583/sealad-pederson-makes-a-strong-throw-to-nab-zunino) from mid-center.

"Hey y'all. We all know that defensive statistics are notoriously volatile in one year samples, and it's recommended that you use 3 years of data to form meaningful opinions on players. 

The problem with that is that WAR relies heavily on a 1 year sample of UZR, which leads to player's WAR being heavily influenced by these fluctuations. Might it be more accurate to calculate WAR with a 3 year rolling average of UZR in place of the 1 year UZR currently used? 

For example, say there is an imaginary player A that played from 1980-1990. Their 1985 WAR is currently calculated by 1985 oWAR+1985 dWAR. Might it be more accurate to say their 1985 WAR is 1985 oWAR+((1984 dWAR+1985 dWAR+1986 dWAR)/3)?

"Every one grab a seat because class is now in session

As a baseball fan all my life, I have never paid intense statistical-based attention to the game until this April. Now with my beloved Mets absolutely killing it on the field (LGM!!), I saw an intrinsic problem with announcer’s favorite old statistic: Runs per Game

While watching Wilmer Flores' walk off home run, I realized all the potential ways a game can end without both team getting 27 outs or getting even more (walk-off, extra innings, weather). The stat I present to fix this problem is Runs per 27 (R/27). It can more accurately calculate the true run production of a team when their performance is adjusted for a nine-inning game. Lets calculate R/27 for the Mets as of 11:59PM August 27 2015. Source for stats: http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2015-batting.shtml

R/27 = (Runs / Total Outs) * 27

R/27 = (520 / 3450) * 27

R/27 = (0.15072463768116) * 27

R/27 ≈ 4.07

This is a more accurate measure as it accounts for all the times there are more or less than 27 outs in a game (home game win, Walk-off, weather, etc.). I thank you for your patience on my first post and would love to hear your feed back on this idea and how to make it better!

"So I found this post on /r/fantasybaseball 


https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/2v18ut/making_custom_projections/

which led me to these sources for making fantasy rankings: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/2v18ut/making_custom_projections/codp6fu

Which leads to now, when I just tried to use this method. What I found was that catchers end up getting ranked extremely high, even in only a 1 catcher 12 team league I was getting Posey ranked as a top 20 bat. 

The reason for this (if it wasn't already obvious), is that the value over replacement for catchers is extremely high, given that there aren't that many good catchers in the league. This causes severe inflation of the score for the catchers who are actually good. Is there maybe a better score to use than the Z-score? It feels unnatural adding a bunch of Z-scores together, but it has been a while since I took a statistics course. I'm not sure if anyone has any suggestions for pointing me towards a better method.

As a quick summary for what I did:
I calculated a Z-score for each of the 5 roto stats using a sample of hitters who have projected AB&gt;400. Then I added those Z-scores to get a single score, Z_UNADJ.
Next, I roughly calculated how many players from each position would be drafted in a 12 team league, and used this to get the value of a replacement player at that position. As an extreme example, in the case of catchers: For a 1 catcher league, the 13th ranked catcher had a Z_UNADJ of around -4.5, which means I added 4.5 to all catchers, giving them a huge boost in the rankings. For a 2 catcher league , the 25th ranked catcher had a Z_UNADJ of around -8.5! This caused Buster Posey to be ranked THIRD overall. What am I doing wrong here?

Is this a valid approach for ranking the value of players for a standard 5x5 roto draft?

I wanted to post here because I thought this would be a great place to get feedback on the mix of stats I should have.

Personally, having FIP and BABIP help me remove the noise when analyzing player and team stats. However, I'm curious if you find yourself wishing you had some other stat in order to make judgements. 

It is hard to fit or code every stat. But I think most people probably have a few they really turn to. Ideally, I would include those.

"Mets prospect Jack Leathersich has an insane 16.4 K/9, but that also comes with a 5.3 BB/9. Last year in his brief stint in AAA, he posted a 14.6 K/9 but a 9.0 BB/9.

"It's no secret that teams are shifting more than ever this season as [they're on pace for over 13,000 shifts this season](http://baseballinfosolutions.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/shift-rates-on-the-rise/)*, up from last year's seemingly impossible record of [8,134. That means from 2011](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/anthony-castrovince-odd-defensive-alignments-the-new-norm?ymd=20140304&amp;content_id=68665254) to 2014 the rate of shifts has gone up over 450%!

Meanwhile UZR, fangraphs' defensive metric of choice and the sole source of their defensive component of WAR, has failed update with the times as [it still flatly ignores any play influenced by a defensive shift](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/anthony-castrovince-odd-defensive-alignments-the-new-norm?ymd=20140304&amp;content_id=68665254). Especially for UZR which relies so desperately on larger sample sizes, this seems absolutely unacceptable. Take a team like the Astros for example [who have been shifting more than anyone and with good results](http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2014/4/28/5650124/early-returns-on-the-shift): [UZR absolutely hates them estimating their defense as 31 runs below average](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2014&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2014&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=19,d) which is why the Astros find themselves with the far and away lowest position player WAR total of any team despite only the 19th worst offensive production. DRS, which while by no means perfect does acknowledge shifts, has those same Astros at -18, so it's not like the Astros are good defensively, but that still seems like too big of a gap.

How much do shifts affect UZR and fWAR? How big of a problem is it? What are the alternatives?

I'm sure most people here are aware of the problems with the batting average statistic, and of the uses of OBP and slugging, so why are these stats tracked for pitchers? In fact, when I went to baseball-reference, I couldn't even find total bases against, which I could have used to calculate TBIP myself.

Check out his [Inside Edge Fielding Data](http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10847&amp;position=SS#fielding) on Simmons' Fangraphs profile (you need to scroll down a bit to view it).  This data is the premise of UZR.  It provides the inputs.

"I know next to nothing about performing correlation tests (I got a 65 in AP Stats) so I'm just using Excel's CORREL function, assuming that it's good enough (I hope it is.)

I used every qualified player from 2002-2014, since that's how far back pretty much all of the data I used goes, so I ended up with 1927 different qualified seasons worth of data.

Stat| r value

So, here's my conclusion. From what I remember from AP Stats combined with a quick google search, I've deduced that a correlation would need to be greater than 0.1 or less than -0.1 in order to be significant. That would mean that the stats that have an impact on BABIP are LD%, GB%, FB%, IFFB%, IFH%, SB, Spd, UBR, and BsR - in other words the better you hit the ball and/or the faster you are, the higher BABIP you're likely to have.

"A couple interesting snippets from **[this fangraphs q and a with Dan Kantrovitz, St. Louis Cardinals Scouting Director](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/qa-dan-kantrovitz-st-louis-cardinals-scouting-director/)**. In my mind all mlb franchises have ridiculous off the field teams that get to use more advanced data than we could imagine getting our hands on. Really intrigued by what varying shifts are happening across the league with the priority of actual human being scouting relative to technology driven data analysis.

This dude is a super stud, Brown undergrad, Harvard masters in stats. And before this gig he was the director of international scouting for the A's from 2009-2011. Obviously doesn't give away any trade secrets, but it is interesting how from a young player/scouting standpoint they are definitely working with data that has more of a human element. Then dumping all that weirdly quantifiable data together with actual baseball statistics and popping out a run based metric.  

Kantrovitz giving us a pea of the tip of the iceberg. Deep down I want to believe that in the long run coaches, managers, front offices are all just a cog in this terminator-esque cyborg machine that achieves singularity. And then there is parity and everyone is happy. The end. *Edit: nevermind, true ending to that story would be dominance by the franchises that ""figured it out"" and $ spent but that isn't a pleasant image.* 

---------------------------------

**On methodology and valuation**

“When you talk about our methodology, it’s not rocket science. It’s more, ‘Find a reliable metric; see what’s worked in the past and use it as a guide going forward.’ As a scouting director, I need to be disciplined to implement it and sell it to our department of scouts, who might not always agree with what we think the optimal decision is.

“Basically, we translate every piece of available information into runs. We have data from scouts, doctors, trainers, quantitative analysts, specialists in pitching mechanics – they all provide an expert opinion on a player. We bake all those opinions together and apply discount rates to enable us to compare players apple to apples in today’s dollars. We basically end up with a present value for every player on our board.

“We try to keep it as scientific and data-driven as possible, but our metrics aren’t our end-all-be-all. Our scouts know that. Any time you’re dealing with amateur baseball players, it’s highly variable. If we didn’t allow some wiggle room — quite a bit of wiggle room in some cases – from the influence of our scouts’ voices, we’d be off.”

-------------------------------


**On communication and analytics**

We spend a lot of time and energy baking-in or combining things like performance data with scouting opinions. At times, it’s helpful to have a feel for how much our scouts need to “like” a player with, say, a poor performance track record, in order for him to be in our draft wheelhouse. Clearly, there are a lot of in-betweens that are not so clear cut or that aren’t so easily distinguishable, Having a background in analytics does help in making some of those judgement calls. But, look, I don’t think you have to have a masters in stats to do this job. I just think it helps in the way that I do this job.

“I don’t spend much time writing code anymore – I did quite a bit of that when I was in Oakland – but there is less time for me to do that in this role, and we have a few really talented guys in our office where programming is their primary responsibility. Guys like Matt Bayer, Dane Sorensen and Chris Correa have done some outstanding analytical work in support of our drafts over the past couple years. Every now and again I’ll delve into the data if I’m curious about something, but my responsibilities are more to interpret the data than to be a day-to-day doer of the data.”",Sabermetrics

However, I don't understand why the constants that determine the linear weights for calculating wOBA should change every year.

* Win %
* Regressed Win % (Regressing 67 games to the mean)
* Pythagorean Expectation (Using RS and RA for April and custom ""Pythagenpat"" exponents for April)
* sOPS+ (As listed on Baseball Reference, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* FIP (Offensive and defensive versions, using the previous years FIP constant, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* wOBA (""Basic"" Speed offensive and defensive versions, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* Basic Baseruns (""Basic"" offensive and defensive versions, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* Technical Baseruns (A more technical version of above.)

Obviously, this analysis could be significantly improved (analyze more data, ""tune"" the various statistics more accurately, analyze more statistics, try different pythagorean exponents, etc.), however, I simply wanted to establish a starting point for future analysis.

From the results I feel pretty confident in suggesting that sOPS+, FIP, wOBA, and Baseruns provide a much better projection for the next month of a teams performance than previous Win%, Regressed Win%, and Pythagorean Expectation, with Pythagorean Expectation being better than previous Win% and Regressed Win%.

I have a casual background with calculus and linear regression from college and decided to finally take a stab at some sabermetrics.

I picked up The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball and cannot mentally move forward without completely understanding how they derived the starting run expectancies for all the events. This is in reference to table 3 in chapter 1. It makes sense that the overall starting run expectancy of 0.546 is derived by taking the average of all the events, but how are the individuals derived? This seems to be important towards conceptualizing wOBA.

I started looking at pitchers with long term low LD% in the last ten years and then noticed a lot of them were no namers who never had continued success. Joe Beimel was one of the names on that list, I noticed his name in particular because not only was I looking for low LD% pitchers but also pitchers who give up a lot of fly balls; Oakland Coliseum (my favorite team) has one of the lowest  HR/FB% in the majors. I noticed him and a few other guys with low LD% also have a very low SO/9 percentage usually in the 6 or 5 range. I didn't understand the correlation so instead of going further down the rabbit hole I decided to come here and ask you guys for further explanation why all this is? Wouldn't guys who have nasty stuff cause more strike outs and also cause more weak contact? I tried looking at O-Swing% and Z-Contact% to clear more of the picture but it just caused more confusion. [The stats at the top of this page are the ones I've been using to evaluate pitchers](http://i.imgur.com/ewg7xLD.png).

"tl;dr Came up with kind of a ""Fermi Problem"" &amp; interesting way of equating two events via **VERY ROUGH ESTIMATES** to find out that they're on the same order of magnitude. It's a crude method and I'd like your help improving it. At the end I will list some assumptions/questions/etc. Also should I have posted this in /r/statistics or go cross-post it?


The other day it occurred to me that, as a mathematical event, a Perfect Game is the same as an event ""27 Consecutive Batters Fail To Reach Base."" I wanted to know if this was empirically true and figured I could make some assumptions due to the (strong or weak?) Law of Large Numbers. My sample size was data going back to 1900. To make it simple I just cut down my calculation to n=100 years.


I guessed there have been roughly 20 perfect games in the MLB (it's 21 official but again, order of magnitude estimate.) I needed to figure out the number of games in a season: with 30 teams and 162 games per team each year, how many games were there? Obviously I can't double-count, so I need to add *unique* events: every team plays 81 home games, which are distinct events, so there are 2430 games per season. So I estimated 2.43x10^3 times 10^2 seasons for a total of 2.43x10^6 games played. 20 of those have been perfect, so roughly, Pr[Perfect Game] = 2x10^1 / 2.43x10^6 ~= 10^-5


Next I wanted to figure out what the all-time ""OBP"" is. This was a little bit trickier - I guessed it was between 0.300 and 0.35. I cheated on this one and went ahead and looked up some data. Off the cuff, I saw more seasons that were near .310 and so just decided to go with Pr[Any batter reaches base all-time]=0.32

Assuming each plate appearance is independent, then Pr[27 Consecutive Batters Fail To Reach] = (1 - 0.32)^27 which gave me a number (distinctly lower, though), yet again, ~= 10^-5


This is really off-the-cuff stuff but I thought it was neat that these two events were on the same order of magnitude and I thought it was cool. Are there major flaws in my thinking? Can you help me find ways to improve this? I just thought this was pretty cool :)


Errors:
1. A string of 27 consecutive batters not reaching base may not imply a perfect game. All I have done is calculate the probability of *any group* of batters to not reach base 27 times. Surely there are other ways for this to happen (split over two games, or just any sequence of 27 outs)  There are a lot of flaws with this because I didn't figure out a way to say ""27 consecutive batters - in a single game.""
2. I assume each plate appearance is independent. Obviously this isn't the case: the more a batter sees a pitcher, the more he'll pick up on what he's throwing and be able to adjust. Yet in a perfect game, assuming the pitcher is ""on his game"" So I justified this assumption by figuring these would just (so conveniently!) cancel one another out.
3. History, in so many ways. There were not always 30 teams. There were not always 162 games. Also...
4. The league-average OBP has increased over time .... BUT there have been more perfect games as of late. What's up with this paradox?
5. The distribution of perfect games throughout time is odd - there was a 30-year stretch with no perfect games, and then in the last 30 years, we've had so many of them. Maybe I should just shrink my dataset to the past 30 years?
6. A ton of other small things.

I'd really love to hear what people have to say about this. Feel free to educate me as well :) Thanks!!!

**note:** I would really like to plot the league-average OBP over the past century, and then mark off the years with perfect games. Any help on the best way to do that?

"In theory if you had better defense in your infield wouldn't you want more groundball pitchers to take full advantage of your infield? Same with flyball pitchers and a great outfield? I was thinking about the 2014 Braves when I had this idea. In 2013 the Braves were 3rd in GB/FB in 2014 we were 24th.

"I had a theory that OBP was undervalued in wOBA. It seemed like SLG was more important in wOBA. I don't think this is groundbreaking or even significant, but when i made the BB's count more the R^2 correlation to runs scored slightly went up. In the google doc i named my new version of wOBA, jOBA. Each jOBA comes numbered with the multiplier i used for BB's (original formula used .69). So, if it was jOBA.71 that means walks were multiplied by .71 in the formula. The last column is original wOBA from the 2013 season and the graphs are the linear correlation of runs scored vs different jOBA's. I'm not sure if this is even noteworthy but look it over and decide for yourself.

"In light of the discussion about trading Gattis, I thought it would be helpful to put together an estimate of how much he'll actually be worth over the time frame we're discussing trading him. As a starting point, I took the fact that Gattis is projected for about 3.3 WAR per 120 games this year and took that as a baseline (hardly scientific but I doubt that many people would come up with a meaningfully different number). I estimated Gattis would provide about 15 WAR over the next 4 years (3.5 WAR next year with an additional .5 WAR per year for framing and .25 WAR decline each year after). Based on some previous arb salaries (namely Buster Posey's settlement after his MVP year), I was able to give a pretty aggressive estimate of how much he'd be paid in his arb years ($8M, $12M, &amp; $16M). Subtracting his value from his pay gave $61.4M in excess value. Discounting framing entirely would reduce his excess value to $47.9M.

Now, this is a rough estimate and I wanted to be make this a collaborative effort, so beneath this paragraph is a link to a Google Doc that you can download and play around with. You can make any changes you want (including discounting framing, changing his arb awards, or putting in a different estimation of his future WAR) and use this to continue to evaluate contract situations in the future.

"Okay, range factor has basically shattered Robbie's reputation as a superior gloveman, and that's fair. During several years of his prime, he was actually below league average for 2B range factor.

HOWEVER, should playing roughly half his games on artificial turf in Toronto be taken into effect? If so, how can that be measured and quantified? (Further, is it true that ground balls go faster on artificial turf, and if so, how much faster?)

In looking at the numbers, Alomar's range factor was above league average at 2B when he played for San Diego, and then it shot to below league average in Toronto, and then it went to slightly above league average when he went to Baltimore. It eventually tailed off around his age 30-31 years, when he went to Cleveland. 

Thus, while Alomar wasn't ever necessarily a god-tier 2B (though he did make it look spectacular on occasion, and something can be said for looking good in a venue that exists to entertain), I would argue that he was still an above-average gloveman, and the artificial turf of Toronto hurt his numbers.

Currently, I am fairly confident in my ability to simulate basic hitter vs. pitcher matchups and the ""three true outcomes"" (K, BB, HR), based on park adjusted daily Marcel projections, using the odds ratio method, however, I am unable to come up with a satisfactory way of simulating basic BIPs. 

The pitcher has some level of control over BIPs, as does the hitter, but so does the defense. 

Does anyone have any thoughts regarding this type of simulation?

* Projecting basic defensive rates will obviously be necessary. Any thoughts on a method? Where to get the data?

* Will it be necessary to project hit type and location? Obviously, this would be more accurate, however, is it absolutely necessary?

* If projecting hit types and location is necessary, I will also have to do this for hitters. Any thoughts on a method?

Im currently teaching myself all about sabermetrics via the Fangraphs website, and I'm a little stumped on how to calculate the above stats, Every time I enter the formula I seem to get the wrong answer, any help with this would be great.",Sabermetrics
"Consider everything behind a run. That run, however it occurred, was simultaneously scored and allowed. If you could determine properly whether it was scored more than it was allowed, or vice versa, you might be from the future. On the scoring side, the run-makers are easy to identify: you have the batters in sequence, or better yet the singular batter, and you have some contribution as well from baserunners, if they are there. Allowing is trickier business, for blame can be allocated to the pitcher for throwing, the catcher for calling and receiving, individual defenders for fielding, the defense for its shift, not to mention any pitchers or defenders who might have been removed earlier in the inning. Those are all the on-field factors behind run production, if I’m not mistaken; we could further muck things up if we broadened our line of thinking to in-game factors, including therefore managers and their ability to determine pitcher-batter matchups at any given moment.

For some runs credit or blame is obvious. Nelson Cruz should have caught that ball. Barry Bonds made a throw so weak the slowest runner in the game scored. The vast majority of runs, however, are subject to countless apportions of credit and blame. Ask 10 people if Mariano Rivera really blew Game 7 in 2001, or Game 4 in 2004. Do the events of those innings fall primarily on his shoulders? There would certainly be those who point instead to the virtues of Luis Gonzalez and Dave Roberts. Even the two obvious examples I cited above have alternate and dissenting readings, held by wackos. We’ve only just begun to quantify all the ways catchers and fielders affect run-scoring. The stats modeling those two factors are years (possibly decades) behind the models for batting.

Batting has long been the most popular and recorded factor behind run scoring. Not only is it easier to discern, but there’s something heroic about the solitary batter overcoming all of the people and circumstances conspiring against him. He counterattacks an incoming missile with controlled intensity and a club, confounding eight other men who have arranged themselves to stop him. Even the playing field, narrow and front-facing, favors the defense, so that even the best players succeed in making a base less than half the time. The rarity of run-scoring contributes to the extra euphoria felt when runs do occur, compared to the scoring and euphoria in other sports. All these are reasons why batting has been measured about as long as the game has existed at a professional level.

Batting might only be the tip of the Run-Production Iceberg, but we’ve been acquainted with and fascinated by that tip for so long that we understand it pretty damn well by now. Batting average had a long, perhaps undeserved reign, then on-base percentage and slugging got their due. Tom Tango’s weighted On-Base Average (wOBA) is the latest and best statistic in that vein. The two shining attributes of wOBA are:

1. It looks at the run-scoring environment before assigning weights to different kinds of batting outcomes, ensuring that the statistic comes out league-adjusted. [Here’s a link](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/1/4/1912914/custom-woba-and-linear-weights-through-2010-baseball-databank-data) to all the weights for each year up to 2010. And [here's a fuller explanation](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/a-visual-look-at-woba/) of the mathematical reasons wOBA works better than OBP and SLG.

2. It is scaled so that the league average wOBA is the same as the league average OBP.

A neat thing about the second point is that you can compare a player’s wOBA and OBP to quickly gauge what kind of power he has. Suppose a player’s wOBA exceeds his OBP by .030 points. You would then know that player has a lot of power, [power that OBP is inherently unable to recognize](http://www.insidethebook.com/ee/index.php/site/article/getting_to_know_woba/).

Furthermore, wOBA has become the foundation for other popular batting measures. Both weighted Runs Created (wRC) and weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA) are based off wOBA and attempt to quantify the raw number of runs produced by a player. While wRC describes the total number of runs a player has created, wRAA calculates runs created relative to league average run-creating. These are both counting stats, so players with more playing time will accrue more. You can find the formulas for wRC and wRAA [here](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/wrc-and-wraa/).

There is one more stat based on wOBA, and it might now be more popular than wOBA itself. Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+) measures a player’s wRC against league average, scaled to 100. This is a rate stat, where 100 is league average, and every number above 100 is a percentage point above league average. Same goes for numbers below 100. No matter how many plate appearances a player had, a 120 wRC+ means he produced 20 percent more runs than a league average player would have in the same number of PAs. It is fully park- and league-adjusted. Read more about it [here](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/wrc/).

Any aspect of the stat may be discussed here. I'll try to get us going.

BABIP stands for Batting Average on Balls In Play. It measures the frequency with which a runner gets on base out of all the times he hits a ball into play, therefore excluding home runs, walks and strikeouts (among other, rarer events). BABIP is frequently cited when predicting future success or downward regression, as it's one of the most volatile stats out there, and any large deviation from the mean is probably influenced by a great deal of luck, whether you're looking at the stat for hitters or for pitchers. Bradley Woodrum, a NotGraphs author, made a tutorial video for BABIP, [here it is on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8XEZlfwCT4).

[Here's](http://midnightbaseball.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/babiplargefunny.png) BABIP in a historical context (I posted this yesterday). You can see that the league average BABIP spiked drastically in the early 1990s. The graph has a silly title that suggests bad defense is the issue, which it could be. It could also be beefed up 'roiding hitters knocking more line drives all over the place. It could be beefed up 'roiding hitters playing worse defense because it's hard to move all that beef out in the field. It could be that small, lithe defenders were losing roster spots to beefed up 'roiding dudes. (It doesn't have to be related to steroids, but come on.) It could be that expansion diluted the pool of pitching talent; or that Coors Field is enormous enough to move the needle a full .020. I was born around this time, so I've never seen the game when played with a .280 league-average BABIP. How sad.

Anyway, I'll end this with four leaderboards.

When you rank all players by ""hitting"" and by ""power,"" and then add the rankings together, you generate a new ranking as follows:  

1. Chris Carter (22nd Hitting; 3rd Power)  
2. Jay Bruce (21;7)

Same for every spot in the rotation. I am assuming the importantce of guys relative to each other is different for different spots in the lineup (although I doubt it is a radical difference and mostly just because of how often specific spots lead off innings)

Would you then say that the ""cost per win"" in a free agent market (or at least for that group of players) is $5 million?  Or is ""win"" derived from another stat like win shares or whatever?

If so how far back to you consider their WAR?  Do you look at a guy's last couple years and determine he's a ""3 WAR"" player or is it just his last season?  Do you use a projection like zips to estimate what he ""should"" do over the length of their contract?

"So I have been trying to figure out relevant splits that are more precise to a specific matchup. Apparantly BvP is not useful in regards to predicting future performance (I don't see how this is the case, but  it seems to be pretty accepted in the sabermetrics community). I have been researching the relevancy of a hitters p/f splits (and also hitters splits against gb and fb pitchers..or more specifically pitchers in the top and bottom third in gb/fb ratio)

So back to the point, pf ratio. I have seen conflicting studies. Some say that it is useful while others say it is not very predictive. 

What are your thoughts on the matter? I am leaning towards believing it can be telling in the most extreme cases, and even at that point I think you should still undervalue the actual split itself (say a guy hits 50 points better against finesse pitchers, I think you can safely assume he prefers facing finesse pitchers but only use about half of that advantage when predicting future performance). Also, I think classifying power and finesse pitchers is another one where the top third and bottom third can be considered powe and finesse and the middle third can be considered average.

"I have had this idea to use kind of a rolling average of RS and RA over a team's previous five games to determine how ""hot"" or ""cold"" the team is.  That by itself isn't so hard, but for obvious reasons I want to weigh wins and losses pretty heavily (that's the name of the game, after all).  I'd also like to weight the results by run differential and opponent strength.  I'm not really sure how to do the latter...would have to throw in strength of schedule, their pythag win %, and their regular win %.  

The idea is to discard the team's season except for the last five games.  Any team can get hot.  If the Twins sweep the Yankees in three games and then the Rangers in four, outscoring both of them by 20 runs, they're hot.  On the other hand if very good teams kick weaker teams asses that wouldn't rate quite as highly.

I figured the ultimate number could be sort of like the temperature thing that Bill James came up with for hitters, but more useful.

"Was reading up on how to regress a hitters K rate, and came across xBB%. [The formula for calculating it can be found here](http://mlbplayeranalysis.blogspot.com/2012/08/xbb.html) although I can't make sense of it. See the basic calculation that I pulled from the article below:

---------------------------

**Ball%**: (1-Zone%) * (1 - O-Swing%)

**CallStr%**: (Zone%) * (1 - Z-Swing%)

**SwStr%:** SwStr%

**InPlay%:** (HBP + GB + FB + LD) / Pitches

**Foul%:** 1 - Ball% - CallStr% - SwStr% - InPlay%

From here, we can use the percentages to calculate the probability that a hitter will walk. To do so, we can break it down into the probability of a walk on 4 pitches, 5 pitches, 6 pitches, etc. and then sum up these probabilities. We get the following components:

**Walk4%:** (Ball%)^4
The chance of a four pitch walk occurring is simply the chance that four consecutive pitches are balls.

**Walk5%:** (4 choose 1) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%) * (Ball%)^4

The chance of a five pitch walk involves a little more thought. The only way that this can occur is if four of the pitches are balls, obviously, but the other pitch is any form of strike (i.e. not a ball in play or HBP). In this case, the strike could come on the first pitch of the plate appearance, or on the 1-0 count, 2-0 count or 3-0 count. Using basic probability math, we have to ""choose"" one location for this strike out of these four possibilities. ""4 choose 1"" evaluates to 4. Likewise we could ""choose"" the four locations of the balls in the first five pitches, and that is why ""4 choose 4"" also evaluates to 4.

**Walk6%:** (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 * (Ball%)^4

The logic used for the six pitch walk is just an extension of the five pitch walk. There must now have been two strikes (of any form) in the first five pitches of the plate appearance before having the sixth pitch be ball four. So again we ""choose"" the location of either the two strikes or the three balls, as ""5 choose 2"" and ""5 choose 3"" both evaluate to 10.

**Walk7%**: (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 *(Foul%) * (Ball%)^4

A seven pitch walk is the first that requires a very particular occurrence to achieve. While the first five pitches are evaluated just like the six pitch walk, in this case, the sixth pitch must result in a foul ball. Any other result would end the plate appearance in the sixth pitch.

**Walk8%:** (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 *(Foul%)^2 * (Ball%)^4

The eight pitch walk is an extension of the logic from the seven pitch walk. In this case, both the sixth and seventh pitches must be foul balls.

**Walk9%:** (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 *(Foul%)^3 * (Ball%)^4

By this point you get the picture. The contributing term from the nine pitch walk is already at most 0.06%, so this is the last term we will calculate in this model. It makes sense, intuitively, as few plate appearances extend into double digit pitch counts.

----------------------------

This version of xBB% will be defined then as:

xBB% = (Walk4% + Walk5% + Walk6% + Walk7% + Walk8% + Walk9%) * N

where N is a constant, league-wide normalization factor (for 2012 to date N=0.75).

---------------------------

***So the question is, what the hell is (4 choose 1)x and (5 choose 2) and is it constant or can it be (4 choose 1-4)x and (5 choose 1-5)x?***

"So when analyzing a players numbers to project future performance there are a million factors in play. One of the most difficult factors to understand and factor out is luck. BABIP is certainly a helpful tool, although it takes 3 seasons before a hitters BABIP gets close enough to its equilibrium that it can be considered useful. So certainly BABIP is a somewhat useful tool to determine which way a hitters numbers will regress.

However xBABIP hit the scene hard and the formula has been tweaked a handful of times since its inception. [I believe the most recent way to calculate xBABIP is courtesy of slash12](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2009/11/10/1124792/a-new-xbabip-calculator)

xBABIP =0.391597252 + (LD% x 0.287709436 ) + ((GB% - (GB% * IFH%) ) x -0.151969035 ) + ((FB% - (FB% x HR/FB%) - (FB% x IFFB%)) x -0.187532776) + ((IFFB% * FB%) x -0.834512464) + ((IFH% * GB%) x 0.4997192 )

A simple explanation is that it takes into account a hitters LD, GB, FB rates and attempts to regress the BABIPs for those types of hits closer to the league average while also taking into account speed (IFH%). 

So what do you guys think about the predictive power of BABIP an xBABIP? Is xBABIP only helpful to adjust previous #s retrospectively?

Going a step further, what the hell is xBA? I haven't been able to find a specific formula explanation, but I believe it is just xBABIP adjusted Batting Average. (comparing xBABIP to a hitters actual BABIP for a given year, determining the difference and than adjust according to how many more hits they should have had...weighted according to how often they put the ball into play relative to the rest of their plate appearances)

----------------------------

Obviously certain players develop certain tendencies, and hitters BABIPs for ground balls, fly balls, and line drives will vary. This is one of the biggest issues with xBABIP in my opinion, but when a hitter has been in the league for a while I think using a combination of BABIP and xBABIP to determine future batting average is the way to go.

And finally, are there any other flaws with xBABIP that I haven't considered?

    I started reading up on Sabermetrics about two years ago and have slowly begun to understand the varying ways by which we analyze players now in today's game. There are still many many different statistics that I don't understand, and which ones that provide the best analysis but that's a post for another time.

I think that what I am most lacking in is not knowing what to do with the information in front of me.

What is the league average for WAR for pitchers, for example. What is an excellent xFIP, can I just correlate that to ERA or is there something more subtle involved?

We've talked a little about this before in terms of weaknesses of defensive stats and so forth, but what specifically do you look for when you're watching a game on TV?  Do you have the spreadsheets open along with websites full of stats?  Do you just watch and that's it?  Do you watch very closely, timing the pitcher's move to the plate with runners on, paying close attention to a swing to see if there's a ""hole"" to exploit, watching pitchers' mechanics?  Combination?

I'm wondering if you guys are statheads in the purest sense of the word or if you have a little ~~Chuck~~ Joe Morgan in you, too.

Personally I don't often pay attention to advanced stats during the game.  I may have a vague recollection of a player's numbers, but even though I usually watch the game at my desk I rarely look these numbers up.  I do that before the game when there's time, and afterward.  While watching I vacillate between watching casually and catching as much detail as the cameras will allow.

The idea is as follows: create a model for how a pitcher should pitch any given batter using expected values and game theoretic decision trees; use the model as a sabermetric surrogate for scouting reports to inform your in-game pitching or hitting plans or measure pitchers against this model to determine if their stats could be better if only they had a better coaching staff or catching unit.

Premise 1: batters will perform better when they know what pitch is coming.
Premise 2: pitchers therefore can't simply rely on one pitch or approach.

A simple example: a pitcher can throw a ball or a strike. If the pitcher throws a ball when the hitter thinks it will be a strike, advantage pitcher. If the pitcher throws a strike when the hitter thinks it will be a strike, advantage hitter.

If we add simple numbers to the above, we can start cobbling together expected values for any given pitch. With expected values, we can create decision trees and optimal results. For example, we can conclude that, when facing a right handed batter with a 30% O-Swing%, 60% O-Contact%, 60% Z-Swing, and 80% Z-Contact, and a 500 SLG, the expected OPS on a pitch outside the zone is 800 (100 SLG + 700 OBP), and the expected OPS on a pitch inside the zone is 480 (240 SLG + 240 OBP) (NOTE: I realize my calculations of OBP here are essentially rubbish, but bear with me). Therefore, the optimal first pitch is a strike. Of course, this calculus changes dramatically if the batter is guessing that the first pitch will be a strike, and it changes further when we add complexities such as what type of pitch to throw, how hard, and where in the strike zone.

So the idea is to develop a computerized model for optimal pitching results (e.g., to batter x, first pitch throw a fastball strike 45% of the time, change up strike 20% of the time, fastball ball 20% of the time, change up ball 15% of the time; if first pitch resulted in a strike, on second pitch throw . . . , etc.), and then compare that to actual pitching results. If a pitcher deviates wildly from his optimal pitching model across many batters, then we can conclude that perhaps better pitch selection would lead to superior results. We could then also compare teams and their coaching staffs, or catchers and their game calling skills. I imagine this information would be extremely useful to a savvy baseball team scouting for woefully mismanaged pitchers to target in a trade. This information could also be useful to fantasy baseball players looking to predict how their favorite pitchers will perform now that they're pitching to Catcher X or have been traded to Team Y.

Curious to hear your thoughts on the above.",Sabermetrics
"I know it's not the most original idea, but it would be something to do.  I think we should have 25 man rosters.  Two catchers, five starting pitchers and a long man, a DH, and fill it out with relievers and bench guys who can play a couple of positions.",Sabermetrics

"So, I'm a Padres fan and that gives me a lot of time to root for other teams. But my criteria for picking sides has a definite saber slant. I like rooting for mostly small market clubs with smart GMs and/or small market clubs with elite talent. 

Most liked this year: Tampa Bay because obvious. Washington with Strasburg and Harper. And I'm pulling for Cleveland.

Teams I hate: Los Angeles, San Francisco (both division rivals with large payrolls that make horrendous decisions), ChiSox (I hate kenny williams), Miami, Texas (for some unknown reason, I think I dislike Nolan Ryan and plus they're freaking juggernauts), starting to hate the red sox.

"What SABR stats do you think are the least worthwhile, and why? Maybe we can dispel some myths and prejudices about some statistics, or point and laugh at some truly meaningless numbers.",Sabermetrics
"Hey all. I'm studying mathematical statistics (basically, applying probability theory in order to develop statistical tests, prediction methods, etc.) at the graduate level. I also have taught undergraduate math for a couple years now and teaching is a love of mine.

Would there be any interest in a sort of crash course in probability and statistics? It really can take any form the community wants and can be as basic or in-depth as we want.

If so, what kind of format would you like, and what concepts would you like to have covered?

EDIT: Not ignoring you all, promise! I'm out of the country for another week and till then I have very unreliable internet. I can't get my computer to connect but my phone works so I'm on that.",Sabermetrics
"I saw a xpost in r/statistics and it has brought me here and I would like to be welcomed or scorned.

I follow baseball when I can and particularly enjoy watching the strategy of pitchers. I revere pin point accuracy and am baffled by the role of luck in the game of baseball. I currently log meta data for a basketball stats company that works with the NBA, NCAA, and other leagues. I am also currently slated to be doing live scoring for NHL games for STATS llc depending on schedule.

I have a good understanding of most stats and why they exist along with some of the challenges sabremetrics is faced with when trying to understand the game. I would like to gain a better feel for the mathematical biases in how these stats are formed.

I am skeptical of most analysis of sports from laymen, not because they are stupid, but because they most likely don't watch enough games and the numbers can always fool you. Or they are stupid. 

I will attempt to interact with the community in a Socratic method and ask questions I have always been curious about. I believe that no one is impervious to misjudgement. And just perhaps, we can learn the old and discover the new that the baseball world has never seen before.

lets play ball.

"Is there a way to get an average for WAR rather than a raw number. I say this because in a season where Player A plays 162 games and has a war of 5 was not necessarily worth more than Player B plays 100 games and has a war of 4.8. I suppose you can't be worth any wins if you aren't on the field but is there some way to average the WAR? I thought of WAR per game but that seemed rather... redudant...

Any thoughts?",Sabermetrics

"Hi r/Sabr! Basically my question is: given that a player gets a hit, how can we best predict (given that player's statistics) what kind of hit it was? Obviously we could just look at his actual lifetime 1B%, 2B%, etc, but I'm referring to something based off of more basic stats. 

To give some motivation: I'm writing a baseball simulation program (nothing fancy, just to teach myself Python), and my current technique was to just get a simple linear regression relationship (for the past few seasons) that relates 1B%, etc, to SLG. They correlate pretty well (for HR% the R^2 is .75; for 1B%, R^2 = .69) but there must be more to it than that, right? Maybe something with K/9? Or maybe it's so park-dependent that this is the best I can do without getting into park factors?",Sabermetrics

Seriously guys. Or at least try to get an IAMA with Bill James or Tom Tango.,Sabermetrics
"I'll start with the RC/wRC question: what explains the discrepancy between a team's combined RC/wRC and the actual number of runs they scored in a season? For example, the combined RC/wRC for the Mets in 2011 was 782/729, but they only scored 718 runs.

The first part now: One thing I like to look at, in terms of team offensive performance, is the percentage of hitters who make it on base that end up scoring. To put it simply, runs/(hits+walks+HBP). However, I'm not sure what an equivalent stat would be for an individual hitter, as to compare him to his team, or league average. I would think wRC/(hits+walks+HBP) makes sense. Or does something else make more sense?",Sabermetrics

Especially on Reddit where you'd think more sports fans would be more analytically minded.  I've found otherwise on r/sports and other sports subreddits.,Sabermetrics
