"I live on the Iowa side of the Quad Cities (think: Davenport).   Because I'm in Iowa, I am blacked out from the Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, and Kansas City Royals.

This is the distance and driving time to each ballpark:

MIN: 5:30 and 354 miles  
MIL: 3:25 and 215 miles  
CWS and CHC: 2:45 and 175 miles  
STL: 4:05 and 270 miles

The reason Iowa is blacked out from all of these is because of the regional sports networks in existence,  2 counties in Northern Iowa get the Twins, two counties in southwest Iowa get the Royals, 3 counties in Southeast Iowa get the Cardinals, about 5 counties near the Wisconsin border get the Brewers, 10 counties in eastern Iowa get the White Sox, and 4 get the Cubs.  


And because MLB is too cheap and/or lazy to spend $50,000 for a location program and about another 50,000 to develop the server software , because Golly Gee Whiz, that's about one game's pay for many superstars, so that the only people getting blacked out are the ones who can actually GET the regional sports station carrying the blacked-out game --- hello MLB!  Fox Regionals aren't carried in most places anymore, unless they're specific to the team in that area --- they just erase the whole @#@%%@ state instead.

Or maybe they're using the ""They may go to the game in person if we don't let them watch it"" argument.  Yeah, that argument worked really well last year when there wasn't any attendance.    Like people are going to drive 300+ miles regularly to go to a game anyway.

It gets really old.  Other leagues offer the option to pay extra to be able to watch in-market games --- not that Minnesota, St. Louis, and Kansas City are in-market where I live.   Have them pay an extra $50 a year and then give some of it to the regionals.  But MLB is still ru nning its version of the old reserve clause, for viewing.  Like the original reserve clause, it was outdated a long time ago, and like the old reserve clause, it will probably take MLB 20 years to fix the blackout nonsense.",mlb

"Warning: rant 

I‚Äôm currently watching YouTube‚Äôs free game of the week. I have mlb tv but usually try to tune into the free YouTube game of the week just to have the unique experience. 

But so often, the experience is ruined by the announcers. They‚Äôre trash. They get off on tangents that have nothing to do with the game of baseball, some of which are kinda edgy. Last game I watched they also said the game was over when the Mets scored 4 in the top of the first vs the diamond backs. Backs scored 5 in the bottom of the first. And just also little things like calling a breaking ball a heater just like, where is your head??

I don‚Äôt know what it is about YouTube‚Äôs coverage, but it is consistently garbage. I‚Äôm 20 years old with my highest level of baseball experience being high school ball and sometimes it feels like I know more about the game.",mlb

**Reddit MLB Record: 4-1**

**MLB Season Record - Fully Tracked: 90-4-50 \[64.3% W/(W+L) rate\]; Average Line Played: +103|2.03x; Profitability YTD: +37.43 Units (Current Unit Size: 4% of bankroll)**

**No parlays. Only straight bets.**

\*\*\*

\- Having trouble finding value on the board so only laying action on one play - it's all about the value on straight bets for me, hence my average line being +103. 

\- J.A. Happ is getting the start for the Twins. After a strong start to his season, Happ has an ERA over 10 in his last 5..

\- King will get the start for the Yankees in the series finale in what's been an impressive start to the season for him. Despite being winless at 0-3, his ERA is only at 3.62. Look for him to get his 1st W tonight.

\- The Yankees are 65-21 in the last 86 meetings against the Twins, for all the ""too small"" sample size folks.

\- They have not done a good job covering the spread thus far (i.e. 26-36 on the season &amp; 3-9 in their last 12) but the Yankees should have no issues running up the score in this one and I'm laying a unit on them to cover tonight. 

Note: Not laying action on it but my model is tempting me to also play the over in this on (10.5). What y‚Äôall think?",mlb

"Hey guys,

I just recently signed up to a local sports service here in Australia and watched my first full game of MLB ever. I loved it and am really keen to find out some more information. So, what makes a team a good run scoring team? Is it pretty straight forward, the best hitters make the team high scoring or is it to do with the pitchers on the defensive team? Also a bad scoring team has average hitters? What stats should I look for when gauging how good or bad a team is at hitting/run scoring? Really interested to hear some opinions thanks!!",mlb

Was considering the Rays and the Athletics, but I am open to other perspectives and teams.

"Confused about the end of the 9th inning for the Tigers game tonight. With 1 out and Eric Haase on first, Isaac Paredes gets robbed on a potential homer run by the left fielder. He is out number #2, Haase then gets double off trying to get back to first for out number 3. 

I couldn‚Äôt find an official mlb rule book covering this year, but all articles about the extra innings rules and the automatic runner on second quote ‚ÄúThe player from the batting order spot who made the last out in the previous inning is who starts on second base.‚Äù

So to start the 10th Paredes is the runner on second. Shouldn‚Äôt it have been Haase starting out on second?  He wasn‚Äôt batting, but his spot in the lineup made the last out. If he does not get doubled off, Paredes is only out #2, so Haase‚Äôs spot in the lineup was the last out",mlb

"Baseball is - and has been - in a weird place for a long time. As more fans drift to the NBA and NFL, it's apparent that there's a disconnect between new fans, current fans, and the sport as a whole. Admittedly, there are a myriad of factors that go into this. But I'd like to bring attention to the concept of personality in sports. 

The NBA and the NFL (to some extent) are fare more driven based on personality. People vibe wit LeBron and Luka because they're the most important person on the floor at all times. With baseball, and all its unwritten rules, the bat flip seems to be a prime example of something the Majors need. Fans get pumped when the players are pumped.

While the current narrative is that the celebration is disrespectful, it seems wildly mild compared to what we see in other sports. Perhaps giving players the freedom to express when they've owned a pitcher is something we can be a little more lax on. 

Would love to hear your thoughts. :) - B",mlb

I received a lot of support yesterday in releasing a few trends &amp; picks that were intriguing to me on the MLB models I've been working very hard on and went 3-0 on what I released on Reddit.

I also received a ton of haters &amp; negative comments and wasn't expecting that. At the end of the day I appreciate all of the comments but just to be clear on a few things:

- On the other end of the mound we have Framber Valdez. Valdez has given up 2 runs in 11 innings on the year so far. He struck out 10 to just 2 walks in that most recent victory over the Red Sox.
- Head to Head Stat - The Under is 10-1 in the last 11 meetings.
- The Under is 9-2 in the last 11 Red Sox games when the Red Sox's road win percentage when facing a right handed pitcher is more than 65% on the season
- The Under is 8-2 in the last 10 Astros games when the runs total is more than 9.5. The runs total is 10.
- Our model projects this game to be between 8.32 - 8.67 Runs (i.e. between 8-9 Runs). Lay a unit on the under in this one.

"A ‚ÄúKris Bryant for JD Davis and prospects‚Äù trade is the most ass backwards thing I‚Äôve ever heard. The Mets‚Äô primary struggles right now revolve around offense, and it may come as a shock to a lot of people pushing for the trade, but Kris Bryant and JD Davis are comparable offensively. Actually, comparable is putting it lightly, they‚Äôre bordering on identical. Kris Bryant made an All-Star game in 2019 with an OPS+ of 133, and JD Davis is constantly in trade talks after posting an OPS+ of 133 in the same exact season. Both JD and Bryant struggled in the covid shortened season, but even then JD outperformed him on a rate basis. That‚Äôs without even mentioning the absolute tear JD was on prior to his injury. The offense needs a shot in the arm, so trading a guy who‚Äôs batting .390 right now with an OPS+ north of 200 who was absolutely raking in his rehab assignments for a bordering on identical (and some could argue worse) offensive player that costs 10 times as much is apparently the only solution. If the Mets trade JD we will regret it for the foreseeable future, and that‚Äôs not even thinking about the prospects we‚Äôd lose in the deal.

"Babe Ruth OF, SP (1914-1935)

Career accolades: Hall of Fame, MVP, 2x all star, 7x World Series champion, batting title, ERA title

Career hitting stats: 183.1WAR, .342/.474/.690 (SLG record), 2873 hits, 714HRs, 2214RBIs, 123SBs

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today. There‚Äôs a reason every player gets compared to him because there‚Äôs none other like the Babe

vs

Mike Trout CF (2011-)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, ROTY, 9x all star, 8x silver slugger, 2x AS MVP

Career stats (as of 2021): 76.1WAR, .305/.419/.583, 1419 hits, 310HRs, 816RBIs, 203SBs

Career highlight: being the first player to hit 30HRs, steal 45 bases and scoring 125 runs in one season

Best season (2018): .312/.460/.628, 147 hits, 39HRs, 24SBs, 79RBIs

Fun feat: Mike Trout was banned from the milk tower carnival game for winning to much

Analysis: take the talent of Griffey and translate it to today and you have trout. An exciting player since day one he has dazzled us since his entry into the league in ‚Äò11. When he‚Äôs injured you feel the effects on the game because he is that fun to watch. Trout is a 5 tool player with one of the best personalities in sports and is undoubtedly the best player playing currently.

"Mariano Rivera CP (1995-2013)

Career accolades: hall of fame, 13x all star, 5x World Series champion, WS MVP, ALCS MVP, AS MVP, 5x reliever of the year

Career stats: 56.3, 2.21ERA, 652SVs (record), 1173Ks, 1WHIP, 1282.2IP

Career highlight: being the only unanimous hall of famer

Best season (2005): 1.38ERA, 43-47 in saves, 80Ks

Fun feat: Rivera has more saves then fellow HoFers Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage combined

Analysis: for many positions you can make an argument for different players as the greatest but when it comes to the greatest closer ever you can only have one name. Rivera is the best closer of all time while only throwing one pitch. His cutter was a nightmare for opposing hitters and any time he came in you could stop watching cause the game was over but you‚Äôd miss one of the best pitchers ever. 

vs

Walter Johnson SP (1907-1927)

Career accolade: hall of fame, 2x MVP, 3x Triple Crown, World Series champion, 5x ERA Title

Career stats: 164.8WAR, 2.17ERA, 417 wins, 1.06WHIP, 3509Ks, 531CGs, 110SHO (record)

Career highlight: throwing a no hitter which was the only one of his career

Best season (1913): 1.14ERA, 36-7, 29CG, 11SHO, 243Ks, .79WHIP

Fun feat: was known as the Big Train for throwing the fastest pitches of his time

Analysis: Johnson was a man amongst boys when put up against hitters of the time. Players back then could‚Äôve sworn they were facing Nolan Ryan with the speeds Johnson was throwing. He was dominate facing the likes of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb in his time. For many he is the greatest pitcher ranking second in wins only to Cy Young

"Full disclosure: I had been an Astros fan my whole life. Way back in 2000, I can still remember my 5-year-old seeing then-brand new Enron Field (now Minute Maid Park) in all its majesty and beauty, rooting for what would quickly become my hometown heroes for the first time. This was back when we were graced with the likes of Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, both household names throughout my childhood. I can also remember the excitement of seeing them reach the World Series for the first time in 2005, and the crushing heartbreak when they didn't win. Their performances in the years afterward had fluctuated leading to some very lackluster seasons, yet I still stood by them no matter what, going to at least one game a year to show my undying support.

Then the mid-2010s came along and they were playing better than ever. The day that they would finally win the World Series - a day I had prayed for for *years* by that point - seemed to draw closer and closer. And as Hurricane Harvey brought chaos and devastation in its wake, fans like myself needed the Astros more than ever.

When they ultimately won the World Series that year, it felt like a Christmas miracle, a dream come true. I would see the trophy with my own eyes at Domecoming 2018, and it seemed like the shame of not having a WS win was finally over.

But... it had just begun.

Imagine how shocked I was when it was reported that they cheated to win that year. I tried not to think about too much, but ultimately I could no longer ignore it: the one time we won the World Series, and they threw it all away. They just couldn't help it. I felt betrayed by my own home team, and began to question my own fandom, especially everytime I see people relentlessly mocking them (particularly on Twitter). And don't get me wrong: I am very respectful of other people's opinions and I understand that we all go through our own different experiences; and Twitter isn't the best platform to go to anyway. But, at the same time... is this what being an Astros fan has become, supporting a team that got caught red-handed while the rest of the world sees them as the villain of the sport? Just thinking about it depresses me. And yet, what could we do? Win another World Series and do so legitimately? Even if there's evidence out the whazoo that we played fair and square, there's still gonna be plenty of people saying things like ""they didn't deserve that win"" or ""they definitely cheated, they're just hiding it from us"". Give up the trophy we have? That would have a better chance at bringing honor back to the team's name, but it would still be on our permanent record and it could take years to finally have our first legitimate win.

At this point, I am in a very difficult position. Perhaps I could be happier if the Astros were just not a part of my life, but at the same time I still have a tendency to support them because the thought of turning my back on a team that I had followed for so long is almost too painful for me to handle. I spoke with one of my relatives about it, and he said the best thing I could do is try to give them a second chance, and that makes sense to me. I believe that second chances are very important, and while it may not be easy I'd like to hope there's a way. I do NOT want that sign-stealing scandal to be the one thing that the Astros are known for for the rest of history. I don't want that for myself, any other Astros fan, or anyone who ever was, is, or will be a part of the organization itself (players or otherwise). But right now, I... I just don't know.

What should I do?

"Ken Griffey Jr CF (1989-2010)

Career accolades: hall of fame, MVP, 13x all star, 10x gold glove, 7x silver slugger, AS MVP

Career stats: 83.8WAR, .284/.370/.538, 2781 hits, 630HRs, 1836RBIs, 184SBs, 5271TBs

Career highlight: going back to back with his dad. 

Best season (1997): .304/.382/.646, 185 hits,  56HRs, 147RBIs, 15SBs

Fun feat: Griffey was the first member of the HoF to hit 40 homers in both the AL (Mariners) and NL (Reds)

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it‚Äôd be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player. If you had the blessing of watching him you knew there was never a boring moment. Iconic is the word to describe him. 

vs

Yogi Berra C, OF (1946-1965

Career accolades: hall of fame, 3x MVP, 18x all star, 10x World Series champion 

Career stats: 59.6WAR, .285/.348/.482, 2150 hits, 358HRs, 1430RBIs, 30SBs

Career highlight: being a staple behind the plate for 10 of the Yankees 27 World Series wins

Best season (1954): .307/.367/.488, 179 hits, 22HRs, 125RBIs

Fun feat: Yogi is the only player to have double digit World Series rings and has the most in MLB history at 10

Analysis: Yogi was the first premier catcher in baseball. Before him the catching position was one of the weaker positions on the field but Yogi revolutionized it with his outstanding defense and prowess at the plate. A lot of people knock him saying he was just carried by the great teams he was on but he was a player that changed a position paving the way for players like Johnny Bench.

"Roger Clemens SP (1984-2007)

Career accolades: MVP, 7x Cy Young, 2x Triple Crown, 11x all star, 2x World Series champion, 7x ERA title, AS MVP

Career stats: 139.2WAR, 3.12ERA, 4672Ks, 1.17WHIP, 7.7H/9, 2.9BB/9, 8.6K/9

Career highlight: breaking the single game strikeout record‚Ä¶ and then doing it again recording 20 strikeouts

Best season (1990): 21-6, 1.93ERA, 209Ks, 1.08WHIP

Fun feat: Clemens won the Cy Young in back to back years twice while winning the MVP in that span

Analysis: Clemens has one of the best pitching careers one can want. The longevity and success of his career is rarely matched by most players winning his first Cy Young in 1986 at the age of 23 while winning his 7th and final Cy Young at 41 in 2004. Clemens had the presence on the mound with the intimidation factor to match.

Cal Ripken Jr. SS, 3B (1981-2001)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, ROTY, 19x all star, World Series champion, 2x gold glove, 8x silver slugger, 2x AS MVP

Career stats: 95.9WAR, .276/.340/.447, 3184 hits, 431HRs, 1695RBIs, 5186TBs

Career highlight: breaking Lou Gehrigs consecutive game streak

Best season (1991): 11.5WAR (most by a SS), .323/.374/.567, 210 hits, 34HRs, 114RBIs

Fun feat: there is a conspiracy that the orioles faked an electrical issue so Cal could keep his game streak alive

Analysis: Cal may not have been one of the most consistent hitters to play the game but his longevity of playing and his glove at short made him a valuable player. Cal was reliable to play and play well. He was never a liability and his best years at the plate made him one of the best SS of all time.

Career highlight: hitting 5 home runs in a doubleheader

Best season (1948): .376/.450/.702, 230 hits, 39HRs, 131RBIs (came within a home run of the triple crown)

Fun feat: Musial has the same number of career hits at home and on the road

Analysis: One of the best hitters to ever swing the bat Stan was the player that future major leaguers looked up too. He was the Ted Williams of the NL with a great presence at the plate while having serviceable defense in the field. 

vs

Lou Gehrig 1B (1923-1939)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, Triple Crown, 7x all star, 6x World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 113.7WAR, .340/.447/.632, 2721 hits, 493HR, 1995RBIs, 5060TBs, 102SBs

Career highlight: Hitting 4 home runs in a single game

Best season (1927): .373/.474/.765, 218 hits, 47HR, 173RBIs, 52 doubles

Fun fact: Lou was the first athlete to appear on a box of wheaties 

Analysis: Lou was the robin to the Babes Batman who blossomed into the Nightwing of the team. One of the men that paved the way for the hard hitting first baseman he batted like only few in the league at the time. Gehrig was a great hitter with good defense at first and a cornerstone for the Yankees dynasty and a legend for more than just his on field skills

I'm doing all the MLB stadiums in blueprint and this is **Citi Field**.

Completed in 2009, it is the home field of the New York Mets. The stadium was built as a replacement for the adjacent Shea Stadium. It was designed by Populous (then HOK Sport).

It has a capacity of 41,922 and the interior design is primarily influenced by the Pittsburgh Pirates' PNC Park.

Citi Field features an overarching bridge motif in its architecture, as New York City is linked by 2,027 bridges and is reflected in the Mets logo. \[Source: Wikipedia\]

"To begin, the league is divided into three divisions: animals, people, and objects/things.

# Division 1: Animals (8 teams)

* Diamondbacks
* Cubs
* Tigers
* Orioles
* Cardinals
* Blue Jays
* Marlins
* Rays

# Division 2:  People (14 teams)

* Braves
* Royals
* Dodgers
* Brewers
* Twins
* Yankees
* Athletics
* Rangers
* Pirates
* Padres
* Mariners
* Nationals
* Mets
* Phillies

# Division 3: Objects/things (8 teams)

* Guardians
* Rockies
* Astros
* Red Sox
* White Sox
* Reds
* Giants
* Angels

Before I go into the skills, advantages, and disadvantages of each team I have to explain a few of the division choices and ground rules:

* the Giants and Angels were put in objects/things due to them not actually being people
* the Nationals, Mets, and Phillies in this case are the people of a Nation, of a Metropolitan, and of Philadelphia, respectively, and therefore fall under the ""people"" category
* if the animal, person, or thing can and normally does harm other animals, persons, or things they are allowed to do so within the extent of the gameplay.  For example, Diamondbacks are venomous and will bite things and kill them- during the game the Diamondbacks can not go and bite the whole other team rendering them useless, however as a strategic advantage they may bite someone running the base path to slow them down, same goes for other carnivorous animals and people who are known to have weaponry/willingness to attack. 
* Any and all projectile weaponry can only be used by a person once per at bat.  For example a Yankee can shoot someone trying to field their hit, but once the shot is taken they must wait until their next at bat to try and shoot someone else, this means they must choose between shooting the person fielding the ball, or the person guarding the base and can not simply shoot the whole team for a homerun each time.
* Innominate objects can move, ie statues can act like what they are made to represent and apparel can skirt around the field.

Feel free to make your educated guess from the above divisions, for a full scouting report on each team continue...

# Division 1- The Animals

* **Diamondbacks-** For this exercise we will say they can grip a bat with their tail to swing, and their strike zone is very very small and low to the ground which results in a ton of walks per game.  On the pitching side, when they work together they could use three snakes to slingshot the ball across the plate, however this leaves two gaps somewhere in the field, and their fielding is rather awful.  However, as mentioned above they have a trick up their fang in their venom, which they can use to temporarily immobilize any fielders they come across, if they can catch them.
* **Cubs-** These baby bears can throw and hit decently, and while they may not have the strength of full grown bears they do have some power and the advantage of a smaller strike zone.  Their lack of speed hurts them on the base path and in the field, but their ability to use their hands or mouth to catch the ball is helpful.  While running they also can help mess up they play with their sharp fangs and big paws.
* **Tigers-** Faster and more violent than cubs, the Tigers are an absolute menace on the base path, the tricky part for them is getting there.  These Tigers use their mouth to hold and swing the bat, while they also catch the ball with their mouth, pitching and throwing requires them to focus hard as they throw the ball from their mouth as well.
* **Orioles/Cardinals/Blue Jays-** The birds, their lack of strength and diminutive size leads to very few hits outside of the infield, however, this group has the advantage of a small strike zone and the ability to fly high and then back down to avoid tags, or attacks, from their in-division rivals- leading to many walks and steals.  They grip the bat and ball with their feet, and their ability to fly leads to very good fielding and very few homeruns. 
* **Marlins/Rays-** As the only marine animals the Marlins and Rays should win nearly every home game (accept when they play each other).  When they travel away you can tell they are very uncomfortable as they play like fish out of water, as they are in fact fish out of water.  

# Division 2- The People

* **Braves-** Native Americans invented many sports that have influenced our modern day games, combine that with the strength and fitness of hunting every day and you have a well trained group ready to tomahawk chop their way to the finals.
* **Royals-** ""Off with their heads"" the Royals are a difficult out on any day, they might not be too good at baseball, but upset them too much and who know what is waiting for you back in the dugout.
* **Dodgers-** Good luck tagging these guys out as they run the base path, too bad for them that you can simply touch the base instead... 
* **Brewers-** What better way to distract the opponent than to brew them endless beer until they are a sloppy mess?  With their endless supply of beer the Brewers can replace all water in the stadium with beer, leading to easy wins against drunk teams... as long as their opponent and not themselves drink their own supply. 
* **Twins-** Are you seeing double?  Nope just the twins in town.  With 18 people in the field their defense can be quiet stellar, and with two people in the batter box they are bound to hit something right?  Better just hope that the twins are athletic, and that they hit the ball and not each other.
* **Yankees/Rangers-** They might not be the most athletic, but their added bonus of rifles and revolvers help make up for any lack in athletic ability.
* **Athletics-** Some of the most Athletic people you have ever met, their raw talent and athletic abilities blow everyone else away- should be easy wins if your opponents didn't have guns, tomahawks, and beer.
* **Pirates/Mariners-** These swashbuckling opponents might not have the sturdiest of legs, but come visit them at their home field out at sea and it is you who will be leaving sick.  In addition to their unique homefield advantage, they too carry the casual side arm and sword in case their is need of it.
* **Padres-** These Friars have God on their side, but that doesn't necessarily turn them into Loyola University of Chicago.  For every athletic friar you get, you also get a friar who decided to spend the last five years living in a cave living off mushrooms.
* **Nationals/Mets/Phillies-** Every game nine randomly selected people are chosen from the nation, metropolitan, or Philadelphia respectfully to start for their team.  You might end up with 9 MVPS in your lineup or you might end up with 9 of [these guys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrqTVFuHxkQ)

# Division 3- The Objects and Things

* **Guardians-** You ever play baseball against 43 foot tall winged concrete statues? No? Well good luck.  Thankfully their are only 8 of them.
* **Rockies-** Ever try and hit a ball over a mountain?  Well you might want to practice for when the Rockies roll into town (you might also want to warn your town).  I am not sure how they hit or throw, but at least their defense is stellar (try sliding into first or running into home with a mountain in the way).
* **Astros-** I honestly would have no idea how this would work, any time they touch the ball it bursts into flames, probably would end up in a bunch of forfeits unless they used some fireproof trashcan to hold the ball.
* **Red Sox/White Sox/Reds-** I would recommend not wearing socks to any of these matches, as they might just turn against you and start working for the other team, other than that I am not sure what else they could do.  
* **Giants-** Like the guardians but not stone, the giants are a very formidable foe.  Their only downfall might be their size as they try and grip a tiny baseball and little bat.
* **Angels-** If we are talking Angels in the Outfield Angels then good luck playing against the best that baseball has to offer, if we are talking biblically described angels then good luck in not being scared shitless and forfeiting on the spot.

So there you have it, who wins and why?  Also feel free to call me out on anything I missed or any other advantages/disadvantages a team should have.",mlb

"I don't want to get into a who did this and that, because there's always a difference of opinion on what should qualify someone for the HOF.. I will only say that it has gotten watered down and cheapened over the last 20 years.

It was once for those who had 500 home runs,3000 hits, 300 wins etc. It was about a player that dominated their position when they played ..

Now we're electing people by 5 different groups..IMO,the BBWAA should be solo in electing members. It was always that way for a long time, and although a few slipped into the Hall that weren't deserving, it was usually pretty accurate 

Jim Kaat was a fantastic pitcher but he's not HOF worthy and none of the others elected today are either, with the exception of Minnosa and Hodges..

"In his letter, it mentioned that a lottery style draft was offered. That just sounds terrible and still could result in teams not spending money or just pure luck (and we all know which franchises have bad luck) sucking for long periods. 

My thought was that we should be rewarding the teams that made an effort. 

Draft pick one should go to the top winning percent team who missed the playoffs. So if there are 10 teams in the playoffs, team 11 should be pick 1. Through rank 30 getting pick 20. The remaining picks should go in order of elimination with the higher win percent getting the higher pick. 

Look at the teams that just missed this year? Or the teams the just traded everything away to get better picks? Or teams that just did nothing because they knew it was their best shot? 

I think this also may result in a little bit more spending from the bottom feeders too and ultimately lead to a much tighter race to the playoffs.",mlb

"To get right to the point, fans should be able to voice their opinion at any sort of mediation regarding the said players association and the owner's commission. Fans bring in the bulk of all the revenue. That includes not just at game revenue with their price gouging on tickets and concessions and merchandise. So why not let the fans have a seat at that table? We're the ones spending the money. Why can't we argue for cheaper ticket prices and lower concession prices and maybe being able to afford a nice jearsey that wouldn't cost 2/3 of my paycheck. It's obvious corporate green. But what does the lockout do? Who does it affect? The fans. The fans are the ones who are affected by the lockout. So they're still making money because we're still spending money on merchandise while they're not playing, but we don't have the luxury of being entertained by the said sport at the time at it's specific arena, stadium, etc. Why must the fans be punished by taking away an entertainment that a lot of us have deeply grown roots into the sports and sports teams. And then the players and owners want to cause a lockout because they can't agree to both be further greedy and want more money on top of certain rule changes that should just be decided and agreed upon by a third party. But ultimately in the end the fans are the ones who are punished, even though we're the ones spending our hard-earned money that a lot of us have to do a lot of physical labor to make that money, but we can't see it or watch a game even on TV because The players association and the owner's commission can't decide who gets to be more greedy. So again fans deserve a seat at the table. We'd be the best mediators, and since we're the cash cow we should be able to throw in our demands since they want to lock it out well let's lock it out but we're going to let the fans get in on this lockouts you want to take away our entertainment well we want some things then in return. Thank you for reading this rant if you made it to the end if not I don't blame you but this is been a topic that has bothered me for a long time about lockouts and how greedy and disgustingly asinine the whole process is by both sides. While we the fans sit back, lack of entertainment, still purchasing that $299.99 all stitched game worn  jersey you purchased off of Amazon. So let's fight back with both of them and demand lower ticket prices lower concession prices lower merchandising prices so that people in a struggling economy can afford to enjoy the entertainment of sporting events without being disappointed by owners and players not agreeing on certain things and destroying our hopes of having a source of entertainment that we really need at this time of uncertainty and drastic changes.",mlb

"Jordan Lyles pitched well today against the spiraling Red Sox (7 IP, 5 hits, 1 run, 6 Ks), but that's far from his norm. He's surrendered 31 homers this year in 138 innings, and last year, he led the AL in ER allowed, posting a 7.02 ERA and 1.56 WHIP.

Dude got a 2-year, $16MM contract from the Rangers in 2019 because he pitched a string of 11 decent games in 2019 for the Brewers: 2.45 ERA, 1.11 WHIP in 58 innings (4.42 FIP). I wonder if they just didn't bother to look at his 8 prior seasons: 5.28 ERA, 1.46 ERA in 768 innings.

About the only consistent positive trait he has as a pitcher is control: 3.1 BB/9 career. Though, that isn't so great when you consider his 10 hits allowed per 9 innings. Not to mention, his 8.4% career swinging strike rate is terrible.

Martin Perez is another: since 2013, when he placed 6th in Rookie of the Year ballots, he's posted a 4.82 ERA and 1.50 WHIP in 929 innings. Again, he doesn't walk many batters (3.3 BB/9), but allows 10 hits per 9 innings, and career swinging strike rate is only 8.2%.",mlb

"In 1995 the Braves won the World Series. The year before there was a shortened season due to the players strike. During their World Series run the Braves started their season sub .500 and in 3rd place before catching fire and taking 1st place from the Phillies and gaining a 4 game lead

Fast forward to today (8-20-2021) after coming one game short during last years shortened season the Braves started this season sub .500 and in 3rd place before catching fire and taking 1st place from the Phillies and gaining a 4 game lead as of today. 

Now I know this means nothing in terms of consequential stats or whether the Braves will even make the playoffs. But baseball is littered with these kinds of lil coincidences and I love it. Do with this information as you will.

"I am really hating a few of the changes to the game this season!

In full disclosure, I never watched a single inning of the 2020 ‚Äúseason‚Äù due to the Covid nonsense‚Ä¶it just wasn‚Äôt real baseball IMO!

So now in the 2021 season, I‚Äôm seeing two particular changes that are really screwing up a lot of games:

1 - starting a runner at 2nd in extra innings, and

2 - playing only 7 innings in a double header ‚Äúcomplete game‚Äù!

Extra inning games have a completely different strategy this year‚Ä¶and it just should not be tolerated that a team can ‚Äúscore a run‚Äù on nothing more than a base hit!

7 inning games? Seriously? Maybe due to Covid or some other EXCEPTIONAL reason, but not just because it‚Äôs a double header!

MLB doesn‚Äôt even schedule double headers any more‚Ä¶we only see them occasionally to make up postponed games!

These are professional players making more money in a season than I will in my lifetime! I think the ‚Äúlittle fellas‚Äù can handle actually playing two regulation games on occasion when it is necessary!

How did the game get so wimpy? A reliever comes in and throws 1 inning and then supposedly can‚Äôt ‚Äúwork again‚Äù for a day or two?

Even the broadcasters these days make it seem like it has been such a ‚Äúlong game‚Äù if it lasts 3.5 or 4 hours!

For me, the cities that I feel should have MLB teams are:

Montreal and Charlotte

Why Montreal? Given the fact that Montreal had the Expos ripped away from them and given to Washington of all places, damn it the city of Montreal loved their Expos. They were and still are passionate about the game of baseball. But also the city has a rich history not just with the Expos but with the game of baseball in general. Plus Montreal is a pretty sports hungry city having the Alouettes and the Canadiens. So it isn't like they can't support an MLB team if one is put back there. They have the money.


 Charlotte because of the fact that they too have a pretty die hard sports city having the Hornets there but also the state in general have the Hurricanes in the NHL and the Panthers in the NFL. So why not give them an MLB franchise and see what they can do with it?",mlb

"**The 2 Expansion Teams:**

After the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays get new ballparks, I believe that these 2 cities have the most serious plans for expansion:

Nashville Stars - (Music City Baseball Group ownership)  
[https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/](https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/)

Portland Pioneers - (Portland Diamond Project Group ownership)  
[https://portlanddiamondproject.com/](https://portlanddiamondproject.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**MY NEW REALIGNMENT FOR 2028:**

With 32 teams, there would be 8 4-team divisions in realignment. The Rays and Rockies would swap leagues to make the geography better.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMERICAN LEAGUE**

|**AL EAST**|**AL NORTH**|**AL SOUTH**|**AL WEST**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baltimore Orioles|Chicago White Sox|Colorado Rockies|Los Angeles Angels|
|Boston Red Sox|Cleveland Guardians|Houston Astros|Oakland Athletics|
|New York Yankees|Detroit Tigers|Kansas City Royals|Portland Pioneers|
|Toronto Blue Jays|Minnesota Twins|Texas Rangers|Seattle Mariners|

&amp;#x200B;

**NATIONAL LEAGUE**

|**NL EAST**|**NL NORTH**|**NL SOUTH**|**NL WEST**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|New York Mets|Chicago Cubs|Atlanta Braves|Arizona D' backs|
|Philadelphia Phillies|Cincinnati Reds|Miami Marlins|Los Angeles Dodgers|
|Pittsburgh Pirates|Milwaukee Brewers|Nashville Stars|San Diego Padres|
|Washington Nationals|St. Louis Cardinals|Tampa Bay Rays|San Francisco Giants|

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REGULAR SEASON SCHEDULE FORMULA (154 Games Per Team):**

&amp;#x200B;

**Divisional Play:**

18 games each vs. all 3 division opponents = 54 games

(Three 3-Game Series Home and Three 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Non Divisional Play Within League:**

6 games each vs. all 12 non-division opponents within league = 72 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Interleague Play:**

6 games each vs. all 4 interleague opponents from 1 assigned interleague division = 24 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

Assigned interleague divisions will rotate annually (4-year cycle). All 4 teams in a division would be assigned the same interleague division.

&amp;#x200B;

4 games vs. interleague ""natural"" rival = 4 games

(One 2-Game Series Home and One 2-Game Series Away)

Would be played on Thursday-Sunday directly after the All-Star break in Mid-July. Thursday and Friday at one ballpark and then Saturday and Sunday at the opposite ballpark.

(Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, Orioles-Nationals, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**54 games + 72 games + 24 games + 4 games = 154-game regular season**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON (12 Total Teams Qualifying):**

In my new postseason format, 12 teams (6 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

In each league, the 4 division winners plus 2 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners would be seeded #1-#4 by record. The 2 wild-cards would be seeded #5 and #6 by record.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Wild card Series (ALWCS &amp; NLWCS):**

(#3 Seed vs. #6 Seed) and (#4 Seed vs. #5 Seed)

The #1 and #2 seeds would have a bye for this round.

Best-of-3 Series. All games in series would be hosted by the #3 and #4 seeds (division winners) regardless of regular season records and played on 3 consecutive days (Monday-Wednesday) right after the end of the regular season. The #5 and #6 seeds (wild-cards) would get no home games for this round.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Divisional Series (ALDS &amp; NLDS):**

(#1 Seed vs. wild card round winner with worst regular season record)

(#2 Seed vs. other wild card round winner)

Best of 5 Series (2-2-1 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Championship Series (ALCS &amp; NLCS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**World Series (WS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).",mlb

Now days Mike Trout or Clayton Kershaw could walk into a restaurant anywhere outside of LA and be unrecognized. I‚Äôm ranting a bit, but does Manfred even want to compete with the NFL and NBA in terms of popularity or are the owners just happy with their TV deals, luxury boxes and revenue sharing? Did I answer my own question? 

TL;DR - thoughts on making baseball relevant again?",mlb

Memorable moments: Drysdale took home the Cy Young Award in 1962 when he won 25 games, at a time when there was only one Award given in the major leagues. In 1968, he pitched 58.2 straight scoreless innings, a record that would stand for 20 years. Included in that stretch of consecutive scoreless innings was a record six straight shutouts.

"This is looking bad for us fans. But I don't think all hope for a full (or 145+ game) season is lost. The next couple of weeks are going to be critical -- and I think the owners just accidentally showed their hand. Here's how the players can take advantage.

And really, it's nothing more than a well-executed PR campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Owners Care What We Think?**

What I'm about to propose wouldn't have made sense two weeks ago.  But a few things have happened since. Rob Manfred gave a laughable stupid press conference  -- it was so bad, the league issued a statement after to clarify his comments. A New York Times writer relayed a conspiracy theory about Scott Boras -- the bogeyman himself -- is the true driver of the players' efforts to do who-knows-what. And now, league water-carrier Jim Bowden is out there [arguing that](https://www.reddit.com/user/trioprice/draft/d4beac94-8e09-11ec-b4e4-d60d846f36c4) ""it's time for MLB players union to make the owners an overwhelming offer."" 

Taken together, it's surprising, but it really does seem that the owners care what the fans and general public think about this whole thing.  This isn't like previous labor impasses where the owners have basically not cared all that much about what fans think or want; they seem to really be concerned that their reputations will be harmed if this continues. Or, more specifically, they seem to understand that die-hard fans understand that this is a unilateral lockout. The owners want us to come around on that, and they want more casual fans to not come to realize that this is a one-sided stoppage. 

And that gives the MLBPA a golden opportunity. One they can very easily seize.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Players Have Messaging Power**

This isn't 1994-5. The players have a direct conduit to fans via Twitter and Instagram and, if they want, TikTok and even reddit. We've seen some organic coordination (the widespread shift to silhouetted avatars on Twitter) and some one-off tweets from players, but we haven't seen a real or coordinated messaging campaign.  

That's the good news for the players. The bad new is that the nuts and bolts about the labor issues are, well, boring and technical. Ending service time manipulation, redoing draft pick compensation, estimating league revenues to determine what a cap/tax should look like, fair wages for minor leagues, etc. -- unless you're a real baseball geek, you don't care. The players need to fight the PR battle without fighting the economic battle.

Here's how to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Message? #UnlockAndPlayBall**

Next week, the players should all show up at their training sites, roughly speaking. Flood Arizona and southern Florida. Wear team t-shirts if you're allowed to (or even better, if you're not; make the teams sue you to take them off). Go to public parks and play catch. Sign autographs. Take pictures and post them to social media. The message on every single touchpoint -- even on the signed baseballs, if you want to go a bit overboard -- should be simple: 

&gt;The fans want us on the field.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to be there.  
&gt;  
&gt;\#UnlockAndPlayBall

Hold press conferences and make it clear: we're in town, we're ready to play, and pitchers and catchers will report the second we're allowed to. And then, toss in the dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Threaten to End the Talks -- But Offer to Make a Resolution Easier**

The owners made a major mistake: they offered to involve federal mediators, if the union agreed. This was an empty offer; they knew the MLBPA would reject it and the owners believed, correctly at the time, that they'd get a PR win out of it. But now -- if the MLBPA adopts my plan above or a similar one -- the offer gives the MLBPA a weapon. The MLBA should agree to involve a mediator only (a) if the owners end the lockout and (b) starting August 1.

It's a brutal combination. The players would be asserting their willingness to negotiate provided that the owners don't ruin the season, which would resonate with fans. (And again, surprisingly, the owners care what fans think this time.)  And second, the players would be choosing a date that was very fan-friendly -- it would, effectively, guarantee a full season, as there's no way the owners would reinstate the lockout weeks before their payday, AKA the playoffs and World Series.

&amp;#x200B;

**It's a Trap (but in a Good Way)**

This strategy effectively traps the owners. They can't turn down the mediation they already offered, and they can't claim that the dispute is two-sided because the players will have made it clear that they're willing to play ball if allowed to. Further, they can't just try again next year, because *the same plan will still work.* If the owners want a resolution, they have two options: make concessions or take the players up on the unlock-and-mediate offer. The owners will have to come to the bargaining table.

"It's starting to look more and more like another BS asterisk season. The problem with this is the ""why"" people watch baseball. If your team sucks for example, you want to see prospects and rookies play well, you cheer for individual achievements etc..  if you team is in the developmental contending stage, every game feels very important, you don't care how they get the Ws you just need em... and then there are the good teams that you expect to win every night and constantly.worry if they have enough pieces for the title run... what these weird reduced seasons , covid BS does is make it all less relevant, less important, no one really cares and there are asterisks everywhere. Being from Toronto M self, last time my team was competitive 1994 happened and that set the team back about 20 years. Here we are again my Blue Jays looking like a force and woops ...rug pull.

"Justin Morneau .321/.375/.559 34 HR, 130 RBI

* After a June 7th loss the Twins fell to 25-33 and 11.5 games behind the Tigers in the AL Central. Earlier in the day Twins manager Ron Gardenhire benched his first baseman who was hitting .237, but Morneau would bounce back by hitting .362 with 23 homers and 92 RBIs over his final 104 games as the Twins went 71-33 in those starts to take the AL Central. Morneau‚Äôs 130 RBIs placed second in the AL. Funny enough, Morneau was never was in the top four hitters of the Twins lineup in 2006.¬†

Derek Jeter .343/.417/.483 14 HR, 97 RBI, 118 R, 214 H, 34 SB

* 2006 was the closest Derek Jeter came to winning an MVP, and it didn‚Äôt help with fans that his only runner-up finish was in one of the tightest votes ever. Jeter matched Joe Mauer at the AL batting lead at .346 with a first inning single on the final day of the season, but would go on hitless the rest of the day to finish second at .343. The Yankees led the AL with 97 wins and 930 runs scored, and Jeter provided a lot on offense. His .381 AVG with RISP ranked third in the AL and ranked sixth with a .369 AVG with two-outs and RISP. Jeter finished second in AVG and runs, third in hits, and fourth in OBP. On the basepath, Jeter's 34 stolen bases was the seventh most in the league, but he got caught only five times and his 87.1% stolen base rate was the third best. Only three other middle infielders even found themselves listed on a ten player MVP ballot by one of the 28 voters.

David Ortiz .287/.413/.636/1.049 54 HR, 137 RBI, 115 R, 119 BB

* After finishing as the AL MVP runner-up in 2005, Big Papi may have had the best season of his career in 2006. Ortiz led the league in home runs, RBIs, walks and total bases, while finishing second in both SLG and OPS. The only player to be a prominent¬† DH and win the MVP was Don Baylor in 1979, and that hurt Ortiz‚Äôs case. After having the division lead the entire month of July the Red Sox finished 23-34 to fall to third in the division and miss the playoffs for the first time since 2002. Yet Ortiz hit 17 home runs with a 1.127 OPS over the final two months when the Red Sox‚Äôs season fell apart.

Frank Thomas .270/.381/.545 39 HR, 114 RBI

* In his 17th MLB season, The Big Hurt spent his first outside the White Sox as he signed with the Oakland A‚Äôs. Thomas, a full-time DH now only started 135 games and never saw the field. Oakland won the division and was 79-56 with Thomas in the lineup card and 14-23 when he wasn‚Äôt. The two-time MVP finished fifth in home runs and eighth in RBIs.

Jermaine Dye .315/.385/.622/1.006 44 HR, 120 RBI, 103 R, 74 XBH, 335 TB

* The reigning World Series MVP had the best season of his career in 2006. Dye finished second in home runs, third in slugging and total bases, and fifth in OBP, RBIs, and extra-base hits. Dye was an RBI machine and hit .351 with a .716 SLG in 178 PA with RISP. The White Sox missed the playoffs but still managed to win 90 games and their offense led by Dye scored the third most runs in the league (86).¬†

Joe Mauer .347/.429/.507 13 HR, 84 RBI, 86 R, 79 BB

* Mauer became the first catcher in history to win the AL Batting Title and led all catchers in every offensive rate. Mauer hit .408 with a 1.200 OPS in 64 PA with two-outs and RISP.¬† A highlight included a five game stretch in June where he became the first player in nine years to reach base four times in five straight games. Mauer was seen as one of the better defensive catchers in baseball and helped the Twins pitching staff that gave up the second lowest run total in the AL. As the Twins won the AL Central it was unclear who their MVP was Morneau, Mauer or Johan Santana.

Johan Santana 2.77 ERA, 19-6, 0.99 WHIP, 233.2 IP, 245 K

* The Twins were second in the AL with both a 3.96 ERA and allowing 683 runs, as they‚Äôre offense ranked below league average by scoring 801 runs. Santana won his second unanimous Cy Young Award in the past three seasons -- and probably should have in 2005. Santana led the league in many categories by huge margins over there second place finishers ERA (2.77 to 3.19), WHIP (0.997 to 1.100), K (245 to 202), K/9 (9.4 to 8.4), IP (233.2 to 223.0), AVG (.216 to .241), OBP (.258 to .279), and OPS (.618 to .653). This dominance led the AL with a 7.6 bWAR, which helped the Twins win the AL Central by one game.

Travis Hafner .308/.439/.659/1.097 42 HR, 117 RBI, 100 R, 100 BB, 129 G

* The third exclusively designated hitter to finish top ten in the MVP voting Travis Hafner was arguably baseball‚Äôs best hitter in 2006. A broken hand in earlier September held Hafner to 129 games played on the season, limiting his chance to win the award. In statistical rates Hafner finished first in OBP and OPS while second in slugging. And despite his missed time Hafner finished third in home runs, four in walks and sixth in RBIs. Hafner‚Äôs six grand slams in 2006 is a single-season MLB record.¬†

Grady Sizemore .290/.375/.533 28 HR, 76 RBI, 134 R, 92 XBH, 22 SB, 190 H, 349 TB

* The 23 year-old centerfielder led the league in runs, doubles, and extra-base hits. While playing every game in 2006 Sizemore proved to be one of the best all-around players in the game with his defense and base-running, which led him to lead the AL with a 7.9 fWAR and finish second with a 6.7 bWAR. With Hafner‚Äôs big season and Cleveland only going 80-82 many voters put Sizemore down on their ballot.¬†

"A player‚Äôs strike in April lasted 13 days and teams missed between six and nine games. Those games were not made up, meaning teams would play a different amount across the board. But the NL would have an MVP debate led by members of their Pennant winner and their worst team. All top five finishes were in their prime and eventually went to Cooperstown.

Johnny Bench .270/.379/.541 40 HR, 125 RBI, 100 BB

* In 1970 Johnny Bench would become the first catcher to ever lead a league in home runs, and he did it again in 1972 -- the next catcher to do so would be Salvador Perez tied for the AL lead in 2021. The big Red Machine won and went 95-59 and their 707 runs scored was the second most in the NL (one run behind the Astros). Bench was one of the main reasons for the output leading the NL with 40 HR and 125 RBIs. Being the most feared power hitter in the NL, Bench walked 100 times and led the league with 23 via intentional pass. But Bench‚Äôs true value many thought was behind the plate. Many regard Bench as the best defensive catcher ever, and in 1972 he threw out 31-56 runners attempting to steal for a league-leading 56% caught stealing.

Billy Williams .333/.398/.606/1.005 37 HR, 122 RBI, 95 R, 348 TB

* Williams was the runner-up to Bench in the 1970 NL MVP, and this would repeat itself in 1972. Williams won the batting title and also led the NL in SLG, OPS, and total bases. But Williams improved with his situational hitting with a .347 AVG with a league leading .466 OBP and .719 with RISP in 163 PA. Williams made his case for the best hitter in baseball in 1972. The future Hall of Famer helped the Cubs go 85-70, but nobody else on the team came within 20 homers or 48 RBIs of Williams. No other player in baseball had the burden of carrying his team‚Äôs offense as much as Williams in 1972.

Willie Stargell .293/.373/.558 33 HR, 112 RBI

* The NL's best record belongs to the 96-59 Pittsburgh Pirates. When Stargell was in the lineup the Pirates went 84-47, but were only 12-12 when he wasn‚Äôt starting. Stargell finished in the league‚Äôs top five in home runs, RBIs, OBP and OPS.¬†

Joe Morgan .292/.417/.435 16 HR, 73 RBI, 122 R, 115 BB, 58 SB

* The eventual two-time MVP would break out as one of the best players in baseball during 1972 for the Big Red Machine. Morgan led the NL in runs, walks, times on-base (282) and on-base percentage. An all-around player, Morgan had the second most stolen bases in the NL and committed only eight errors at second base for a fielding rate of 99.0%. Morgan‚Äôs situational hitting helped the Reds have the second best run output in baseball, having a .427 OBP in the 117 innings he led off in while also having a .339 AVG with RISP. A highlight for Morgan was also being named all-star game MVP when he had a walk-off single.

Steve Carlton 41 GS, 27-10, 1.97 ERA, 346.1 IP, 310 K

* Before the 1972 season, the Phillies traded for Steve Carlton by sending the Cardinals Rick Wise in what turned out to be one of the biggest lopsided trades in MLB history. In 1972 Carlton won his first of four Cy Young awards, but it didn‚Äôt matter much to the franchise as they went 59-97. That means Carlton alone was the winning pitcher for the Phillies in 27 of their 59 wins, which made 46% of his team‚Äôs wins a major league record. Of winning almost half of his team‚Äôs games Carlton said ‚ÄúI consider that season my finest individual achievement.‚Äù The Phillies went 29-12 when Carlton started, and went 30-85 when he didn‚Äôt take the bump. Carlton also went at least nine innings in 29 starts, and threw 30 complete games. Carlton led the NL in starts, IP, ERA, CG, K, and wins.¬†

"There was a battle between Don Mattingly and Rickey Henderson for the most valuable Yankee with the debate centering over which is more valuable: scoring runs or driving them in and how much does base running and defense impact a game. George Brett had arguably his best season, while Wade Boggs in his fourth season raised his career batting average to .351.¬†

Don Mattingly .324/.371/.567 35 HR, 145 RBI, 107 R, 211 H, 86 XBH, 159 G

* Mattingly followed up a batting title and third place finish in the 1984 AL MVP, by winning the MVP in 1985. Mattingly led the league in RBIs, extra-base hits and total bases, finished second in hits, SLG and OPS and fourth in home runs. His ratio of 35 home runs to 41 strikeouts may have been the most impressive statistical feat by a hitter in 1985. The Yankees won 97 games, but it was not enough to make the playoffs as New York lost to Toronto on the season‚Äôs final day when they were trying to force a game 163 with them. Mattingly usually hit second or third in the lineup and created a devastating combo with leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson which helped the Yankees lead baseball with 839 runs scored.

George Brett .335/.436/.585/1.022 30 HR, 112 RBI, 103 BB, 108 R

* At age 32 the 1980 AL MVP may have had the best season of his twenty-one year hall of fame career. Brett led the Royals to 91 wins and the AL Central title by carrying their offense down the final week of the season. The Angels were leading the Royals by one game for the AL West entering the final eight games of the season, and Brett then went on a tier. Going 11 for 23 (.478 AVG) with five homers and 13 RBIs and eight extra-base hits over in his final seven games to take the division by a game. The Royals won four straight games to clinch the division -- with Brett homering in each -- and a highlight included hitting a two-run home down four runs in the sixth inning of game 161 to start a comeback rally to clinch the division. Brett‚Äôs situational hitting was exceptional hitting .340 with a .514 OBP with RISP in 218 PA, and those numbers rose to a god-like .396 AVG, .623 OBP and 1.103 OPS with two-out and RISP in 77 PA. Overall Brett led the AL in SLG and OPS, while finishing second in AVG and OBP while hitting a career-best 30 home runs and 103 walks.¬†

Rickey Henderson .314/.419/.516 24 HR, 146 R, 72 RBI, 80 SB, 99 BB, 143 G

* In his first season as a Yankee, Rickey led the league in runs and stolen bases, was third in OPS and fourth in AVG and OBP. His 146 runs were the most since 1950 and he became the first player since Jimmy Foxx in 1939 to score more runs than games played (nobody has done it since). Rickey set a Yankees all-time record in stolen bases and became the first 20/80 player ever as he hit 24 HR and had 80 SB. Rickey‚Äôs OBP was 48 points higher than Mattingly while his slugging was 51 points below. Rickey himself believes he lost the MVP by having a great start to the season and not finishing as well, he had a .357 AVG and .993 OPS before the all-star break, but those numbers fell to .270 and .875 in the season‚Äôs second half. His defense at center field was exceptional as total zone rating has him saving 13 runs on the year. Thus, his 9.9 bWAR and 9.7 fWAR both led the league showing his all-around game‚Äôs value.

Wade Boggs .368/.450/.478, 8 HR, 78 RBI, 107 R

* Boggs‚Äô 758 PA was the sixth most ever in a season, and he combined that with impressive statistical rates by winning the batting title and leading the league in OBP and finishing fourth in OPS. Boggs‚Äô 240 hits were the eleventh most in a single-season and the most since 1930, while his 340 times on-base was the eight most ever and most since 1949. The one down-side was his power with only eight homers and 53 extra-base hits. Boggs‚Äô 187 singles would be the second most in the twenty century, as only Lloyd Warner in 1927 would have more.¬†

My pick is Travis Hafner

I grew up watching the mid 2000s badass Cleveland Indians and man, pronk was a beast. He tied the MLB record with six grand slams in a season in 2006. Led the AL in SLG and OPS that year, hitting .308, 42 hrs, 117 RBI MVP numbers, but not even an all star.",mlb

"2000 NL MVP

The 2000 MVP was a close finish by two Giants teammates, and Barry Bonds would be the runner-up before winning four straight MVPs. Todd Helton came the closest anyone has come to hitting .400 since Ted Williams.¬†

Jeff Kent .334/.424/.596 33 HR, 125 RBI, 90 BB, 114 R

* The Giants cleanup hitter was put in positions to deliver with men on, as Barry Bonds would hit the spot before Kent and produce a .440 OBP with a league-leading 117 walks. With men on-base, Kent slashed .382/.482/1.114 helping Bonds score the most runs of his career. The second baseman led all NL middle infielders in homers, RBIs, OBP, BB and SLG as the Giants 925 runs still to this day ranks second in franchise history since the start of the twentieth century. Giants manager Dusty Baker chose Kent as his pick. Bonds said of Kent‚Äôs season, ‚ÄúThe numbers he puts up for a second baseman are amazing. They're great for any player, but to do it at second base is really something.‚Äù¬†

Barry Bonds .306/.440/.688/1.127 49 HR, 106 RBI, 129 R, 117 BB

* Bonds was already a three-time MVP, but hadn‚Äôt won the award since 1993. His RBI total may not seem high for a player with 49 home runs, but pitchers feared Bonds adding a lot to their numbers. 73 of his league-leading 117 walks were with men on-base, giving him a .519 OBP in those moments and leaving Kent with important at-bats. Bonds was becoming more powerful than ever with a career-high in home runs and slugging. Game of Shadows would report that Bonds started using steroids after the 1998 season and with an injury-plagued season in 1999, 2000 was the first year Bonds would see the results of his new physique.¬†

Mike Piazza .324/.398/.614 38 HR, 113 RBI, 90 R

* Mike Piazza had his best season as a Met in his hall of fame career. He led the catches in home runs, RBIs, total bases, batting average and slugging. The Mets won 94 games and took the wild card. Piazza may have been higher on this list had he started more than 129 games. New York was far better with Piazza in the lineup going 76-53 with him, and only 18-15 without him.

Jim Edmonds .295/.411/.583 42 HR, 108 RBI, 129 R, 103 BB

* In his first year in St. Louis Edmonds set career-highs in just about every offensive category. Already known as one of the best defensive center fielders ever, Edmonds helped the Cardinals stay afloat and win the NL Central with a 96-67 record as Mark McGwire missed 73 games.¬†

Todd Helton .372/.563/.698/1.162 42 HR, 147 HR, 138 R, 59 2B, 103 XBH, 103 BB, 216 H

* In the middle of an August 21st game, Helton‚Äôs AVG was .400 (178 H/ 447 AB) becoming the first player since Ted Williams in 1941 to be a qualified hitter and reach the mark. Helton could have got injured or decided to sit out the rest of the season and make history. While Helton couldn‚Äôt sustain the .400 his season was impressive. The Rockies first baseman led the league in hits, doubles, RBIs and total bases. Along with 42 home runs and 103 walks. Helton‚Äôs 103 XBHs were tied for the most in a single-season since 1930. Helton became the first player since 1937 and only the fifth ever to produce a 200 hit, 40 HR, 100 RBI, 100 R, 100 XBH, 100 BB season -- and the fifth player ever joining Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Fox and Hank Greenberg. Helton also became the seventh player to lead the league in the AVG, OBP, and SLG since World War II. But many voters held it against Helton that his numbers were inflated because he played at the mile-high Coors Field. In 1999 his teammate Larry Walker also led the league in AVG, OBP and SLG. Helton home numbers were huge in 81 games having a .391 AVG, 1.242 OPS, 27 HR, 92 R, with 88 RBIs. but his road numbers also could have kept him in the MVP race alone, having a .353 AVG, 1.071 OPS, 15 HR, and 59 RBI. Helton led the NL with a 8.9 bWAR and 8.3 fWAR. The Rockies finished 82-80, but with the best offense in the NL scoring 969 runs.

Vladimir Guerrero .345/.410/.664 44 HR, 123 RBI, 101 R, 197 H

* The 2000 Expos had the third worst record in baseball, going 67-95 but Guerrero may have been the one bright spot. His league leading 23 intentional walks proved many pitchers would rather face the rest of the Expos lineup than go up against Vlad. Still Vlad managed to set franchise records in home runs and batting average. This season is likely the best by a position player in Montreal history, as Vlad also is arguably the best player in Expos history.

Jeff Bagwell .310/.424/.615/1.039 47 HR, 132 RBI, 152 R, 107 BB

* Still to this day, Bagwell‚Äôs 152 runs scored are the most since 1936. Bagwell had a .487 OBP in the 113 innings he led off in and a .460 OBP when zero-outs. His 295 runs over a two years span (99-00) is the most in NL history. Despite the Astros scoring 938 runs, the pitching staff gave up 944 and the team finished 72-90. Bagwell had the best full season of his hall of fame career with a career-high 47 homers.¬†

Andrew Jones .303/.366/.541 36 HR, 104 RBI, 122 R, 199 H

* Jones was seen as the best defensive player in baseball as he roamed center field, as total zone rating had him saving 25 runs in 2000. At only twenty-three years old Jones set what would be his career-highs in runs scored, batting average, and hits. The Braves won 95 and the NL East, and Andrew was now considered the best Jones on the Braves as he outperformed the reigning MVP Chipper.¬†

Gary Sheffield .325/.438/.643 43 HR, 109 RBI, 105 R, 101 BB

* Sheffield had a big season at the plate in 2000, ranking third in the NL in OBP and OPS, and fourth in SLG. Sheffield also hit .357 with a 1.135 OPS with RISP. His case for the award fell as he was a well below outfield and baserunner. He committed 10 errors in left field and was caught stealing in six of ten attempts.¬†

Sammy Sosa .320/.406/.634 50 HR, 138 RBI, 106 R

* Although he hit 60+ home runs three times in his career, 2000 was the only season where Sosa led the league. But the Cubs had another rough season in 2000 losing 97 after losing 95 in 1999.¬†

"2003 AL MVP was probably the wildest race in baseball history. Not only was it one of the closest, but it featured TEN different players getting a first place vote -- there are only 28 votes. Alex Rodriguez won his first of three MVPs after narrowly missing out on the award numerous times.

Alex Rodriguez .298/.396/.600/.995 47 HR, 124 R, 118 RBI, 161 G

* A-Rod was probably better each of the previous three seasons. But this was still his peak A-years. Playing his final season in Texas and at shortstop (he would be traded to the Yankees), the best player in baseball centered around Bonds, Rodriguez and Pujols. But he had yet to win an MVP, while finishing second in both 1996 and 2002 (both likely should have been his) and already had arguments for winning in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Alex led the AL in HRs, Runs, and slugging. He led the AL in both bWAR (8.4) and fWAR (8.4). But only Andre Dawson in 1987 had won an MVP on a last place team before. The Rangers finished 71-91. But the real reason they finished last in the AL West was because their pitching staff finished with a 5.67 ERA, easily the worst in all of baseball. Texas‚Äô pitching staff performed so poorly that the 969 runs they gave up was the third most by a team since 1940. The day he was named MVP A-Rod told ESPN ‚ÄúIt's been a rough three years in Texas.‚Äù

Carlos Delgado .302/.426/.593/1.019 42 HR, 145 RBI, 109 BB

* Delgado had the biggest offensive season in the AL in 2003, leading the league with a 1.019 OPS and 145 RBIs. But where Delgado really upped his game was in 219 PA with RISP, he .357/.507/.650/1.157. The Blue Jays finished a respectable 86-76 for third place in the AL East -- possibly the toughest division in baseball with the Yankees and Red Sox who would match in in the ALCS. Delgado was both average in the field and on the base path. He made a final week push for the award by hitting four home runs in a game on September 25th. After finishing second the Blue Jays star told ESPN, ‚ÄúObviously, I was expecting to get the award and that wasn't the case. If they were going to pick somebody from a team that did not make it to the playoffs I think it would have given me an edge, but that's what I get for thinking, I guess.‚Äù

Jorge Posada .281/.405/.922 30 HR, 101 RBI

* The Yankees won 101 games in 2003. Derek Jeter got injured on opening day and missed a month and a half. Jason Giambi had batted .330 from 2000-2002, but fell to .250 in 2003. Bernie Williams Batting average dropped 70 points from 2002 to 2003. After Alonso Soriano finished 3rd in the 2002 MVP voting, there was a narrative that a new bunch of Yankees had arrived with veterans Paul O‚ÄôNeill, Tino Martinez, Scott Brosius and Chuck Knoblauch now gone. Posada had a solid season, but catchers just usually aren‚Äôt at the top of offensive categories. With the Yankees still winning 101 games with an adjusting team in 2003, Posada was seen as the best candidate on the league‚Äôs best team. Many voters felt it was enough to win the award when there wasn‚Äôt a clear favorite.¬†

Shannon Stewart .307/.364/.459 13 HR, 90 R, 73 RBI

* The strangest seasons to ever finish in the top five of an MVP. Stewart never made an all-star team in his fourteen year career. In 2003, Stewart played his first 71 games with the Blue Jays and Delgado before being traded to the Twins on July 15th where he played his final 65 games. At the time Minnesota was 7.5 games behind the Kansas City Royals in the AL Central. Then Minnesota would go 44-21 with Stewart playing on their way to winning the division (48-51 without Stewart overall). The Twins also went 9-4 in August and September against the eventual 43-119 Tigers. Many voters were persuaded that Stewart was the reason for the Twins midseason surge, but prior to Stewarts arrival the Twins had an 4.74 ERA and once he arrived that staff‚Äôs ERA dropped to 3.96. But after July 17th the Twins averaged 5.3 runs per game, while before they scored at a rate of 4.5. Stewart had a decent season with the Twins slashing .322/.384/.470, but his season numbers look to be a borderline all-star.

David Ortiz .288/.369/.592 31 HR, 101 RBI, 128 G

* After a solid 2002 season, the Twins non-tendered Big Papi which led to the Red Sox signing the slugger to one year $1.25 million contract contingent that he makes the team out of spring training. Ortiz only started 117 games (73 at DH) and pinch hit in another eleven games. Only Don Baylor in 1979 was a primary DH to win an MVP. Ortiz‚Äôs 31 homers with 101 RBIs and a .961 OPS were solid, but would eventually be one of his least productive seasons in Boston. Along with Ortiz‚Äôs surprise the Red Sox won 95 games and took the Wild Card.

Manny Ramirez .325/.427/.587 37 HR, 104 RBI, 117 R, 154 G

* Manny led the AL in OBP and lost out on the batting title to teammate Bill Mueller by a single point. Manny also finished second with a 1.014 OPS. What really hurt his case was comparing him to himself. Over the previous five seasons Manny averaged 0.98 RBIs per game (664 RBIs in 667 G), while that number fell to 0.68 per game in 2003. But it was tough to see Manny‚Äôs fault with a slashline of .338/.512/.603 with RISP in 215 PA. While Manny‚Äôs offense was superb, he was seen as arguably the worst outfielder in baseball.¬†

Nomar Garciaparra .301/.345/.524

* Nomar looked to be firmly in the MVP race, but he had a miserable final 25 games of the season where he hit .162 with only seven extra base hits and took him out of the race. While Red Sox players finished 5th, 6th and 7th in voting it was hard to see who voters felt was the team‚Äôs MVP. Each hit well, but were seen as liabilities defensively.¬†

Vernon Wells .317/.359/.550 215 H, 118 R, 117 RBI, 33 HR, 87 XBH

* Wells had the best year of his career in 2003. He led the AL with 215 hits, 49 doubles, and 87 extra base hits while playing center field. Wells would go on to win deserved gold gloves, but metrics were not as kind to him in 2003. The reason for Wells finishing below where his numbers would suggest is many voters valued his teammate Delgado as the team‚Äôs MVP candidate and couldn‚Äôt wrap their mind around having two candidates on a third place team.

Carlos Beltran .307/.389/.522 26 HR, 100 RBI, 102 R, 41 SB

* The Kansas City Royals had the second lowest payroll among MLB teams in 2003, and finished 83-79 despite a weak roster. Beltran was one of the best defensive players and base runners in baseball. His total zone rating had him saving 15 runs in center field and his 41 SBs in 45 attempts gave him the highest SB% (91.1) in the AL. Beltran‚Äôs game had zero weakness, and was among the very all-around players in the game.

Brett Boone .294/.366/.535 35 HR, 117 RBI, 111 R, 75 XBH

* After losing out on the 2001 AL MVP in a very tight vote to his teammate Ichiro, Boone had another career year in 2003. His 117 RBIs led the second baseman, and his 35 HRs finished second among his position in the AL.

**My ballot**

1. **A-Rod 2) Delgado 3) Beltran 4) Wells 5) Soriano 6) Pedro 7) Boone 8) Ordonez 9) Posada 10) Manny**

"I've enjoyed baseball in my life, but I'll admit for most of my life, come Fall my attention tends to sit on football.  Recently, I've started to be more and more bothered by the inaction of the NFL in what commentators summarize as ""off the field issues.""  Since I don't pay as much attention, I don't know. Is MLB any better?  I don't hear about as much, but I don't pay as much attention so I'd really like to hear it from the dedicated fans here.",mlb

"what the title says. im a die hard NFL fan and id say im just an average fan of the NBA. usually in those two leagues, when a team has two players that are superstars there are at least an average to above average team at worst. I am wondering why this isn‚Äôt the case with the Angels. Im just now getting into baseball on a deeper level (thanks to The Show 21) so i don‚Äôt fully understand baseball like i do football and basketball.",mlb

"The 1955 MVP was full of voting controversy as Roy Campanella edged Duke Snider. There was debate as to who was the better Dodger, who was New York‚Äôs best center fielder, and who was the best young player in baseball. Nine of the top 10 finishers in the voting found their way to Cooperstown. It was the first of roughly ten MVPs Willie Mays fans feel he was snubbed.

The race went 1) Roy Campanella 2) Duke Snider 3) Ernie Banks 4) Willie Mays 5) Robin Roberts 6) Ted Kluszewski 7) Don Newcombe 8) Stan Musial T9) Hank Aaron T9) Pee Wee Reese

Roy Campanella .318/.395/.583 32 HR, 107 RBI

* Campanella would win his third MVP of the previous five seasons. Seen as the best catcher of his era, Campanella threw out 23 of the 44 runners who attempted to steal a base off him for a caught stealing rate of 52%. Campbell only played in 123 (making 118 starts), and the Dodgers were 80 and 38 when he was in the lineup card as opposed to 18-17 when he didn‚Äôt go. Campanella was clutch with a .381 AVG and 1.097 OPS with RISP. The Dodgers won the NL pennant, and the now thirty-three year old Campanella was seen as their leader.¬†

Duke Snider .309/.418/.628/1.046 42 HR, 136 RBI, 126 R, 104 BB, 82 XBH

* In the 25 years since the MVP was introduced in 1931 this was the seventh time teammates finished first and second in voting in either league (there were only eight teams in each league at the time). Snider led the NL with 126 runs 136 RBIs and tied for the lead with 82 XBH, while finishing second in OBP (.418), SLG (.628), and OPS (1.046). Snider‚Äôs 42 home runs was his third consecutive season hitting at least 40 and would continue it for another two. Duke was the biggest contributor to a Dodgers offense that led the league with 857 runs scored (5.6 r/G), 96 more than any other team in the league. There was a lot of debate amongst Dodger fans and baseball fans on who was more deserving, Campanella or Snider. Controversy ensued as a story of a hospitalized voter sending a ballot listing Campanella both first and fifth without naming Snider, and instead of throwing out the ballot altogether Campanella was awarded a first place vote -- if that ballot was discarded or placed Snider in the top five he wins. The second Campanella was likely intended for his teammate. Baseball journalist Joe Posnanski discovered this later on. Bill James would say on the more deserving Dodger debate ‚ÄúIt is pretty far-fetched to argue that Campanella was better than Snider. You would have to exaggerate his defensive value to heroic proportions.‚Äù

Ernie Banks .295/.345/.596 44 HR, 117 RBI, 98 R, 82 XBH

* Banks had his breakout year in 1954, hitting a single-season record 44 home runs by a shortstop. Banks also set a single-season record of five grand slams, going seven for twelve with two walls together with the bases loaded. Banks tied for the league-lead with 82 XBH, and was fourth with 117 RBIs. His Performance was not enough to help the lovable loser Cubs, who finished 72-81 for sixth place amongst eight teams.

Willie Mays .319/.400/.659/1.059 51 HR, 127 RBI, 123 R, 82 XBH, 24 SB

* Willie Mays is widely considered the greatest player of all-time. In 1954 he won the NL MVP and led the New York Giants to a World Series victory. 1955 Mays was just as good as any year in 21 year career. He led the NL with 51 HR, 13 3B, .659 SLG, 1.059 OPS, 382 TB and even 85.7 SB% while his 82 XBH tied for the league lead. Mays‚Äô .319 AVG, 123 Runs, 127 RBIs, and 24 SB all ranked second in the league. His 9.1 bWAR and 9.0 fWAR all obviously led the league as Mays is considered by many the greatest center fielder of all-time -- but trying to evaluate 1950s defense is difficult today. With Mickey Mantle also at his peak in the AL New York‚Äôs three center fielder‚Äô were future Hall of Famers Mays, Mantle, and Snider all at their apex in the 1950s. The Giants finished 80-74 for third place in the NL, while New York‚Äôs other two centerfielders played in the Yankees-Dodgers world series.

Stan Musial .319/.408/.566 33 HR, 107 RBI

* Already a three time NL MVP and three time runner-up Musial had his eight 100 RBI season and sixth 30 home run season. But as Musial played for the Cardinals for over twenty-three years, their worst season was 1955 as St. Louis went 68-86 finishing second to last in the NL.

Hank Aaron .314/.366/.540 27 HR, 106 RBI, 105 R

* In just his second season at age 21 Hank Aaron made his first all-star team in 1955 and led the league with 37 doubles. His 27 homers at him finish the season with 40 total in his career. This was also Aaron‚Äôs first 100 RBI season, he would go onto have 11 of them and still holds the most in MLB history at 2297. Aaron also started 26 games at second base, the most he would appear in the infield until the 1970s when he played first base. The Milwaukee Braves would finish second in the NL with an 85-69 record.¬†

Eddie Matthews .289/.413/.601/1.014 41 HR, 101 RBI, 108 R, 109 BB

* Matthews would finish 18th in NL MVP voting. Yet, he was among the best hitters and players in the NL. For the third consecutive year he hit more than 40 home runs and drove in more than 100 and became feared enough to lead the league in walks with 109. As the season uncluded, Mathews, still only twenty-three years old, had the most home runs (153) before turning twenty-four in baseball history.

"The 2011 AL MVP had a deep field, with many candidates taking the lead at various points post all-star break. Six different players received a first place vote among the 28 voters.

The race went 1) Justin Verlander 2) Jacoby Ellsbury 3) Jose Bautista 4) Curtis Granderson 5) Miguel Cabrera 6) Robinson Cano 7) Adrian Gonzalez 8) Michael Young 9) Dustin Pedroia 10) Evan Longoria

Justin Verlander 24-5, 2.40 ERA, 251.0 IP, 250 K, 0.92 WHIP

* Verlander became the first pitcher in nine seasons to win at least twenty-four games. The Tigers went 25-9 in JV‚Äôs starts, while going 70-58 when he didn‚Äôt pitch. On July 21st the Tigers were tied for the AL Central lead, and that night began Verlander's streak of winning his next twelve starts with a 2.28 ERA in 87.0 innings. The Tigers won the division by 15 games. Verlander went at least eight innings in fourteen starts and at least seven in twenty-six starts. He led the AL in Wins (24), ERA (2.40), starts (34), strikeouts (250) and WHIP (0.92). A notable moment was his no-hitter thrown on May 7th, and taking a June 14th start five outs away before finishing with a two-hit shutout. He won the AL Cy Young unanimously, and finished first in the league in bWAR (8.6) but fWAR (6.5) was far lower.

Jacoby Ellsbury .321/.376/.552 32 HR, 105 RBI, 212 H, 119 R, 39 SB

* The Red Sox center fielder won the Comeback player of the year after only playing 18 games in 2010 because of various injuries. Ellsbury had 32 homers and 105 RBIs, nearly becoming the second player in MLB history to hit the century mark from the leadoff spot alone (97 RBIs in 144 games at the top of the lineup). These impressive RBI totals were because Ellsbury hit .366 with a 1.111 OPS with RISP in 145 plate appearances (PA). Those numbers rose to a .400 AVG and 1.227 OPS in 70 PA with two-out and RISP. Playing centerfield, Elssbury was also rated well above average with 9 DRS, which helped him win his first gold glove. A speedy baserunner Ellsbury did swipe 39 bases but also got caught stealing 15 times. Ellsbury led the league in both extra-base hits (83), total bases (364), fWAR (9.5), while finishing first among position players in bWAR (8.3). The Red Sox entered September with a division lead and nine games up on the wild card, but went 7-20 to finish 90-72 and not make the postseason. Yet Ellsbury was the only bright spot in that 27 games span alashing .358/.400/.667 with 8 homers 21 RBIs, and 22 runs scored.

Jose Bautista .302/.447/.608/1.056 43 HR, 103 RBI, 132 BB

* Bautista had his best season in 2011, leading the league in home runs (43), walks (132), slugging (.608) and OPS (1.056). Bautista was also tied with Ellsbury for the lead in bWAR (8.3). But what really hurt his case was the Blue Jays finishing fourth in the AL East at 81-81 and his situational hitting. Bautista hit .245 with a .436 SLG with RISP in 110 ABs, and that may have been because he got nothing to hit because he also walked 64 for a .519 OBP in those situations. His AVG and SLG fell to .216 and .378 in 67 PAs with two-out and RISP, while his OBP went up to .567. While Bautista was clearly the best hitter in the AL, at best he was close to average in the outfield and on the base path.¬†

Curtis Granderson .262/.364/.552 41 HR, 119 RBI, 136 R, 25 SB

* The Yankees manager Joe Girardi said in late August that his center fielder was his MVP pick because of getting runs. Granderson led the AL with 136 runs scored (fifteen more than anyone else) and 119 RBIs. While finishing second in the league with 41 homers. From 1948 through 2010 there were 14 players who led their league in both runs scored and runs batted in, and 11 won MVP (along with Kemp in the NL, it happened in both leagues during 2011 and neither won MVP). Granderson played a premium position at a solid level, and helped the Yankees take 97 games and the AL East title. Even though he led the league in RBIs, he left many on the table in the Yankees lineup slashing .242/.303/.516 with RISP in 188 PA and .208/.266/.389 with two-out and RISP in 78 PA. In his final 35 games he had a .188 AVG as New York clinched the division.¬†

Miguel Cabrera .344/.448/.586/1.033 30 HR, 105 RBI, 108 BB, 197 H

* In 2011 Miguel Cabrera won his first of three consecutive batting titles by leading the AL with a .344 AVG. Cabrera, playing his eighth full season in the majors,¬† led the league with a .448 OBP, 48 doubles and 308 times on-base. His 1.033 OPS finished second to Bautista. Cabrera led the AL Central winning Tigers in runs, hits, extra-base hits, homers, runs batted in and across the slash line. But at the time, many saw it as a down year for Miggy because he hit 30 home runs and batted in 105. Over his first seven full seasons he averaged 34 homers and 117 runs batted in. One may think that his situational hitting was the reason for him not driving in runs at his normal rate, but it was quite the opposite. In 2011 Miggy hit .388 with a 1.191 OPS with RISP in 197 PA, and slashed .382/.539/.724 in 102 PA with two-outs and RISP. Entering August the Tigers were 57-51 and 2.5 games up in the AL Central, then Miggy slashed .408/.491/.648 the rest of the way as the Tigers went 38-16 and won the division by 16 games.

Robinson Cano .302/.349/.533 28 HR, 118 RBI, 188 H, 81 XBH

* With Jeter, A-Rod, and Texiera past their peak, Cano was now seen as the Yankees best player, and one of the best all-around players in baseball. Cano fell one RBI (118) shy of the league lead behind his teammate. Cano‚Äôs season was also highlighted by winning the home run derby in Phoenix, and his 29 homers on the season were the third most by a middle infielder in the league. His 81 extra-base hits only trailed Ellsbury in all of baseball, and in the field he became one premier second baseman in baseball. 2011 was the second of five consecutive seasons where Cano would finish top six in the AL MVP voting.

Adrian Gonzalez .338/.410/.548 27 HR, 117 RBI, 213 H, 108 R

* The Red Sox acquired Gonzalez in the offseason prior, and it paid off immediately. Entering August first the Red Sox were leading the AL East and on pace for 100 wins (66-40) as Gonzalez at the time was leading the league with a .357 AVG and 90 RBIs looking to be the frontrunner for the MVP award. Gonzalez didn‚Äôt play badly the rest of the way, but his numbers fell and the Red Sox collapsed and didn‚Äôt make the postseason. His 213 hits were tied for the most in the AL. Gonzalez only made three errors and 12 DRS made him an elite first baseman.¬†

Michael Young .338/.380/.474 11 HR, 106 RBI, 213 H

* Young was proving to be one of the most consistent players of the previous decade. In 2011 he tied for the league lead with 213 hits, his sixth 200 hit season. A highlight also included his 2,000th career hit, the first player in a Rangers uniform to get there. His .338 AVG and 106 RBIs were career highs. His .377 AVG with RISP were a huge help to the Rangers lineup, as for the first time in his career Young was the Rangers‚Äô primary cleanup hitter (starting 89 games fourth in the lineup). In 2004 Young moved from 2B to SS for the acquisition of Alfonso Soriano, then to 3B in 2009 for the arrival of Elvis Andrus, and now in 2011 to DH after signing Adrian Beltre. Young‚Äôs consistency in the lineup was important for the 96-win Rangers, as Nelson Cruz, Josh Hamilton and Beltre all missed significant time due to injury. Yet, his defensive versatility was just as important as he started games at each infield spot (39 at 3B, 36 at 1B, 14 at 2B, 1 SS).

Dustin Pedroia .307/.387/.474 21 HR, 91 RBI, 102 R, 26 SB

* The 2008 AL MVP had arguably his best season in 2011, hitting a career-high 21 home runs. Being one of the best middle infielders in baseball, Pedroia finished 3rd in both bWAR (8.0) and fWAR (7.9) among AL position players. After a disappointing first two months of the season, Pedroia would get hot with a .342 AVG and .959 OPS in his final 104 games. Between the Red Sox miserable September and many MVP candidates on the team Pedroia fell in the race.

Evan Longoria .244/.355/.495 31 HR, 99 RBI

* The most memorable moment of the season -- and one of the best in baseball history -- was Longoria's walk-off home run against the Yankees on the season‚Äôs final day to clinch the Wild Card. Longoria‚Äôs eight inning three run blast also helped the Rays comeback from a seven-run deficit in game 162. Longoria struggled with injuries and had his worst season in his then four year year career, but still finished with 31 homers and 99 RBIs. Also due to his exceptional play at third base, Longoria finished 7th in the AL with a 7.2 bWAR.

"The 2007 NL MVP was full of debate with many players representing different arguments such as counting stats vs rate statistics, hitters ballpark, home runs and RBIs vs all-around production.

The Race went 1) Jimmy Rollins 2) Matt Holliday 3) Prince Fielder 4) David Wright 5) Ryan Howard 6) Chipper Jones 7) Jake Peavy 8) Chase Utley 9) Albert Pujols 10) Hanley Ramirez

Jimmy Rollins .296/.344/.531 778 PA, 129 R, 212 H, 30 HR, 94 RBI, 88 XBH, 41 SB

* Rollins was the Phillies leader. The Phillies were down seven games in the NL East race to the Mets with seventeen games remaining, then the Phillies went 13-4 and won the division on the season‚Äôs final day. Rollins was seen as the best glove at shortstop in baseball, and won his first gold glove. Although he was seen as clutch, his OPS fell over those final seventeen games. His clutch narrative continued as many pointed out he almost had 100 RBIs (he had 94) from the leadoff spot (he started 139 games leadoff and the other 23 in the three-hole). Rollins hit .272 with RISP and that dropped to .239 with two out and RISP. Many loved to point out that Rollins had a 20-20-20-20 season (20 HRs, 20 2B, 20 3B, 20 SB), as both Rollins and Curtis Granderson became the third and fourth player ever to do so and the first since Willie Mays did 50 years prior. But Rollins' season can be summed up as a compiler. He set the all-time single season plate appearance record being up 778 times. And his league leading 139 runs were helped out by 2006 MVP Ryan Howard and Chase Utley hitting behind him.

Matt Holliday .340/.405/.607 36 HR, 137 RBI, 120 R, 216 H,92 XBH

* Holiday led the league in AVG (.340), hits (216), doubles (50), extra-base hits (92), RBIs (137), and total bases (386). While Holliday‚Äôs numbers were remarkable, many loved to point out the Coors field effect. Holliday's batting average dropped 75 points on the road (.376 to .301), his slugging dropped 237 points (.722 to .485) and his OPS dropped 297 points (1.157 to .860). He also had 25 homers in Denver compared to 11 everywhere else. This led many to believe Holliday was a solid player, but Coors field made him an MVP candidate. While many were focused on the historically hitter friendly park, holiday was clutch down the stretch. The Rockies won 12 of their final 13 games -- including a game 163 against the Padres for the wild card -- to make the postseason. In that stretch Holliday slashed .442/.532/.846/1.378 with five homers, 17 RBIs, and 16 runs. Holliday was seen as nothing special in the outfield, while his base running made for a heated debate after a walk run scored in game 163 where replays showed he didn‚Äôt actually touch the plate.¬†

Prince Fielder .288/.395/.618 50 HR, 119 RBI, 90 BB

* Prince a league leading 50 home runs in 2007, and along with his dad Cecil became the first father-son duo to have a 50 homer in major league history. But Fielder didn‚Äôt rate well beyond the plate and had a low WAR -- bWAR (3.6) and fWAR (4.7) -- for someone who was as productive as he was at the plate. Meaning he was miserable everywhere else. The Brewers finished 83-79, and he was often overshadowed during the season by his teammate Ryan Braun, the NL Rookie of the Year winner.

David Wright .325/.416/.584, 30 HR, 107 RBI, 34 SB

* The Mets blowing a seven game division lead with seventeen games left probably cost Wright the MVP award. Voters couldn‚Äôt see themselves awarding a player who let his team sink when it mattered most. Yet, Wright was phenomenal in those final seventeen games hitting .397 with a 1.027 OPS. For his ability at third base and stealing 34 bases Wright was becoming known as possibly the best all-around player in baseball. Wright became the third 30-30 HR-SB player in Mets history. He led the NL in fWAR (8.4) and finished second to Albert Pujols in bWAR (8.3). Wright even upped his game with runners on base, hitting .332 with a 1.004 OPS. Wright didn‚Äôt lead the league in any offensive category which made his stats seem less eye-popping, but was near the top of every category. Although his team‚Äôs position hurt his award chances, he was still on a second place team that won 88 games.

Ryan Howard .268/.392/.584 47 HR, 136 RBI

* Howard was the reigning NL MVP winner. 2007 was the only season from 2006 through 2009 where Howard didn‚Äôt lead the league in RBIs, falling an RBI shy of Holiday for the title. While his 47 homers, 136 RBI and .976 OPS were impressive most saw Howard -- like Fielder -- as a liability everywhere else. His 2.9 bWAR and 3.2 fWAR suggest he didn‚Äôt lead the Phillies to the division title.¬†

Chipper Jones .337/.425/..604/1.029 29 HR, 102 RBI, 134 G

* At age 35 Chipper led the NL in OPS at 1.029 and fell three points shy of Holliday for the batting title. He broke the century mark in both runs (108) and RBIs (102), and his bWAR of 7.6 ranked among the top of baseball. Had Chipper not missed 28 games and done better than a .241 AVG in 54 ABs in two-outs and RISP he may have won the award.

Jake Peavy 2.54 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 240 K, 19-6¬†

* Peavy won the NL Cy Young award unanimously. Leading the league with 19 wins, 240 strikeouts, 1.06 WHIP and a 2.54 ERA. But with the season on the line in a game 163 tiebreaker, Peavy didn‚Äôt win his 20th game and instead gave up six runs in 6.1 IP. Along with another start in September where he gave up eight runs, Peavy could have helped the Padres clinch a playoff spot and failed to do so. With a 2.10 ERA on september 1st, Peavy was in the MVP race.

Chase Utley .332/.410/.566 103 RBI

* Overshadowed by two other MVP winning teammates, Utley was the Phillies best player in 2007 when on the field. Had a hit by pitch not broken his hand at the end of July causing him to get surgery and miss over a month Utley would have been firmly at the top of the debate.¬†

Albert Pujols .327/.429/.568 32 HR, 103 RBI

* In 2006 Pujols finished second in a controversial MVP vote. And 2007 saw him not even enter the MVP race due to setting career-lows in his seventh season of home runs (32), RBIs (103), runs (99), and XBH (71). He had the second lowest AVG of his career (.327) and OPS (.997) while leading the league grounding into double plays with 27. The reigning World Champion Cardinals went 78-84. It got so bad that his own manager Tony La Russa even left him on the bench the entire all-star game, as if so many other players had passed him making it difficult to find a moment for him to be on the field with baseball‚Äôs best. The Machine wasn‚Äôt happy about his time on the bench. Pujols also led the NL in bWAR (8.7) and was second in fWAR (7.7). His numbers across the board were MVP caliber, just not at the level of his usual argument for greatest right-handed hitter ever. Pujols would go on to win the MVP the next two years.¬†

Hanley Ramirez .332/.386/.562 125 R, 212 H, 29 HR, 83 XBH

* The 2006 NL Rookie of the Year proved to be one of the game's best players in 2007. The shortstop was stuck on the 91 loss Marlins but still had a monster season. And he would eventually finish second in the 2009 MVP.¬†

"2000 AL MVP had one of the deepest ballots (ballots include 10 players) we‚Äôll ever find in a race

1. Jason Giambi 2) Frank Thomas ) A-Rod 4) Carlos Delgado 5) Pedro Martinez 6) Edgar Martinez 6) Manny Ramirez 8) Darin Erstad 9) Nomar Garciaparra 10) Derek Jeter

Breaking down each player

Giambi .336/.476/.647/1.123 OPS with 43 HRs, 137 RBI and 137 BB

* Led the A‚Äôs to 91 wins and the AL West title, Giambi had a monster season at the plate and with one of the best seasons ever in the batter‚Äôs box. This made his argument for and against are straight forward. Giambi was the catalyst offensively for a team that scored 947 runs. Giambi made 148 starts and accumulated 664 plate appearances. Although he didn‚Äôt provide much on the base path or on defense (Giambi played first base and DH 24 times), there was a gap in the Batter‚Äôs box between Giambi and the rest of the field.

Thomas 328/.436/.625/1.061 43 HR, 143 RBI, 115 R, 112 BB

* Thomas was in a similar argument to Giambi. And it shows how voters viewed the award at the time, as the two took 24 of the 28. Like Giambi, Thomas was among the leaders in RBIs, HRs, BBs and putting up big numbers across the slash line. Thomas played in 159 and had 707 plate appearances for the 95 win AL Central Chicago White Sox. The Sox also baseball with 978 runs scored. The Big Hurt was the main reason with his presence in the batter‚Äôs box. Thomas though was primarily a DH with 127 starts that didn‚Äôt include fielding. Winning the MVP would make him the second primary DH to win (1979 Don Baylor)

A-Rod 316/.420/.606/1.026 41 HR, 134 R, 132 RBI, 100 BB

* Although A-Rod has said his two best seasons were 1996 and 2007, bWAR would disagree and say it was this season at 10.4. Alex played in 148 games, all starts at shortstop and only made 10 errors at the premium position with a phenomenal 98.6% fielding percentage. The Mariners won 91 games and took the wild card (although had the same record as division champ the A‚Äôs), and A-Rod carried the offense with Ken Griffey Jr. having been traded to Cincinnati before the season. It was clear this season who the best all-around player in the game was, even if there were a couple hitters slightly better. As one of the faster players in the game, Alex was also an above average base runner and led all position players in WAR. This being his contract year worked out perfectly, and A-Rod would get $252 million -- double the guarantees more than any athlete ever and worth more than the value of many MLB franchises at the time.¬†

Carlos Delgado .344/.470/.664/1.134 44 HR, 137 RBI, 196 H, 123 BB, 115 R

* Delgado was the one player who could truly argue that he was a better all-around hitter than Giambi. Delgado also didn‚Äôt miss a game for the Blue Jays, making all 162 starts at 1B. Turley a contender for the award in every sense, voters didn‚Äôt value knocked Delgado compared to Giambi and Thomas because the Blue Jays only went 83-79, finishing 3rd in the AL East.¬†

Pedro Martinez 1.74 ERA, 284 K, 11.8 K/9, 8.88 K/BB

* Pedro famously finished second in the 1999 AL MVP after two voters snubbed him from their ballot altogether. But 2000 may have been the greatest pitching season of all-time (MLB ranked it #1 in their top nine pitching seasons ever in 2009). He led all players in bWar at 11.7 and set the all-time WHIP single season record at 0.737. His 1.74 ERA was the lowest ERA during the American league DH era (still standing for a 162 game season). The entire AL‚Äôs ERA was 4.91 and Roger Clemens finished second in ERA at 3.70 proved how amazing Pedro was. The one knock on Pedro is he started only 29 games and pitched 217.0 Innings. Unfortunately voters held it against him that Boston only won 85 games, and Pedro finished with only 18 wins (deGrom would think that‚Äôs a decent amount though).¬†

Edgar Martinez .324/.423/.579/1.002 145 RBI

* The future Hall of Famer was in his peak years and led the league in RBIs. The DH was a huge part of the Mariners winning 91 games, and provided A-Rod nice protection by usually hitting the spot behind him at cleanup

Manny Ramirez 351/.457/.697/1.154 122 RBI 38 HR

* In his final season in Cleveland, Manny led baseball with a 1.154 OPS and the highest of his career. Manny even had more RBIs (122) than games played (118). But the games played took him out of the race, which he may have even won had he not missed 44 games due to injury.

Darin Erstad 355/.409/.541/.951 240 H, 25 HR, 100 RBI

* The only outfielder in the top ten, Erstad had 240 hits - a total that has since been only passed by Ichiro. But Erstad didn‚Äôt find many ways to get on base and had the lowest OBP of any top ten finisher. Erstad‚Äôs bWAR (8.3) does rank second on the list.

Nomar Garciaparra 372/.434/.599/1.033 21 HR, 96 RBI

* Peak Nomar had a monster year with a .372 batting average -- still the highest number of the 21st century. Playing a premium position at short also made him more valuable, but he didn‚Äôt play it well. Also he only made 136 starts do to injury dropped him down to the bottom of the top ten.

Derek Jeter .339/.416/.481/.896 119 R, 201 H

* The only player on the World Champions to appear on the list. Jeter had his third consecutive 200 hit season in 200 and played a premium position at shortstop - although not particularly well. Jeter hit well and got on base, bu didn‚Äôt have a high batting average.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

**My Ballot 1) A-Rod 2) Pedro 3) Delgado 4) Erstad 5) Delgado 6) Giambi 7) Garciaparra 8) Thomas 9) Edgar 10) Jeter**

"So if a pitcher is ejected, like Santiago today, they confiscate his glove and sent it to the league, then what. What if the league determines he didn‚Äôt have banned item in it, just rosin like he claims?  Is he automatically suspended regardless?  Seems like one of the (many) bad  parts of the rule. If he is innocent, he was wrongly tossed from the game. Wouldn‚Äôt it be more reasonable to just take the glove/hat whatever and make them change? Then if upon official inspection suspend him?",mlb

that means a great outing with something historic happening (in this case 10 straight strike outs tying a record) but get little to no run support and the pitcher who had the great outing being the only person on his team to drive in a run.,mlb
"Yes they did and that is why betting on baseball is so tricky. Normally, I don't make this many bets on baseball because of that. 162 game season can make it feel like you are playing on a slot machine.

For example, The Padres are 2-6 when Lamet starts so it makes the -270 line a very poor value in terms of investment.

"Im not the type of person who thinks everybody‚Äôs number should be retired just cause they had a few good years with the team. I dont think varitek‚Äôs should be retired (i know they didnt retire it) even though he was as great of a leader as pedroia. But pedroia‚Äôs shouldve definetely been retired. 

Pedroia brought 3 championships to boston (im counting 2018 because even though he only palyed a few games he was definitely a vocal leader). In the last 100 years only Him and Ortiz can say that. I think before the injuries started he was on his way to be a sure hall of famer. 

Even before the machado injury i think he was borderline hall of famer at that point. The injuries will bring him down in the eyes of many voters just like it did to david wright so i doubt he will be voted in. I can see him make it under the veterans committee.

Pedroia was hitting like his old self prior to that injury. In my opinion he was an all star snub in 2016. The fact that he may not make the HOF should not be an excuse for the red sox to not retire his number. I know john henry will probably not let anybody wear that number without pedroia‚Äôs  permission but lets make it official. 

Pedroi‚Äôs final stats: hits 1805 BA .299 HR 140 rbi 725 in 14 seasons (12 seasons  if you dont count the last two years where he played 9 games and stats are almost the same)

So this is a two part question:

Should the sox retire pedroia‚Äôs number?

Do you think pedroi will make the HOF?",mlb

"Ok so we all know how most feel about tatis. But in general he‚Äôs overrated. Now let me tell you why. First, he has shown the inability to stay healthy and rather  play injured rather then get healthy and play better, while obviously it‚Äôs has clearly only effected him defensively, he‚Äôs still not playing to his full potential rhat he can/should. Secondly, it‚Äôs funny to me how ‚Äúhe isn‚Äôt bad at fielding he just can‚Äôt throw‚Äù is used as a decent argument but those ppl are the same ppl saying jeter is overrated STRICTLY due to his fielding(but that‚Äôs another post lol) but anyway if they player cannot throw the ball, the very first thing we learn to do on the field, then why does he deserve to be considered the best in baseball when he really isn‚Äôt. And I know y‚Äôall will say ‚Äúhe only made throwing errors because he was hurt‚Äù, but to that I ask, why is he playing if he‚Äôs hurt? The Padres already have a good lineup if it‚Äôs this serious that will effect him until ASG then there is clearly more wrong then what he thinks and needs the time off so a somewhat-minor injury doesn‚Äôt end in something bigger. Now lastly we have the ppl that say ‚Äú You can‚Äôt blame him for being hurt‚Äù when while yes you cannot blame the player, if he knows he is still in pain and needs time off so he stays stronger instead of further more injuring himself, ANY MANAGER will be okay with benching the player for a few days. As I see it he‚Äôs either to egotistical and arrogant to take the time he needs, or doesn‚Äôt know how to communicate/know what‚Äôs best for his body. So to wrap it up, is Tatis good, yes. Is he best currently? No is he best ever (like I‚Äôve seen many ppl say) Not at all. But ASG worthy but still other ss‚Äô that deserve the praise over him.",mlb

I have a question for anyone who has been to spring training. How do people come back from those games with hundreds of baseballs? Just saw several people have spring training baseballs for sale online. I am very curious how they get that many.,mlb
"I don't understand why mlb doesn't establish a baseline rpm for each pitcher's pitch and if there's a deviation in game check them for substances.  Solves all the tension happening right now and doesn't slow the game down.

Just have an official mlb personnel go to each team and have each pitcher throw a quick pen and measure the spin rate. Then monitor in game....",mlb
"Look I get that checking every opportunity, every inning is ridiculous. There should be a device that shows spin rate spikes so that we can see if anything got tampered with in between. We should never see what happened to Max scherzer happen again.

There are however, pitchers like Gerrit Cole literally complaining about not being able to use foreign substance [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH72VLCcNpA&amp;ab\_channel=iTalkStudios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH72VLCcNpA&amp;ab_channel=iTalkStudios) . This is ridiculous no? Well if that is the case, if you are saying you should be allowed substance that increase your performance, might as well go all out then. Lets also have the hitters be allowed PED and steroids. That is only fair right? 

This is actually ridiculous. They are openly admitting that they are using substance to help them with their game, and they need to make an adjustment without it. HELLO?

"At an undisclosed hotel in Boone NC, I met this strange, strange man. Before I continue, I should clarify that it could have NOT been him, but given his appearance, and all of the weird breadcrumbs he gave us, I am almost certain it was him. 

I had just gotten back from the bathroom when I saw him having a conversation with the front desk worker. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, except for the fact that my friend, let‚Äôs call them Worm, was standing up at the front desk as well. I know Worm pretty well, and their eyes were pleading with me. Though it took me a moment to realize, something was obviously wrong. I came up and stood behind the counter with my two coworkers, not entirely sure just what was wrong, until I actually heard the man speaking. He was asking our front desker, let‚Äôs call her Hannah, some very intrusive questions. He was fishing, very poorly, for her email (like, not phone number or something easy, but her email?) and saying stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a pretty good guy to know, just sayin‚Äô, like, if you ever wanna guy to talk to, you know, you can hit me up.‚Äù Just some basic, terrible, uncomfortable flirtatious stuff, but then it got really weird when he said something to the effect of ‚ÄúYou can get in contact with me when you- you know, if you break up with your boyfriend, or like, if your father dies, you know, and you get some alimony or something,‚Äù (which is not something I think you collect when a relative or in-law dies?)

He was very full of himself, quite literally talking about how he went to law school, and passed with a 4.0, and oh, how he played football in Miami (which he felt the need to clarify to us foolish mortals, was in Florida.) Hannah mentioned that she wanted to go to New York, and he was just telling her all this stuff about how ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from Boston, you can‚Äôt go to New York, that‚Äôs where- people up there are just, they‚Äôre conniving. It‚Äôs where all the immigrants go. It‚Äôs where they end up.‚Äù And like, really messed up stuff like that. He then left, assumedly went to his car, and came back wearing a some sports beanie, holding a laminated print out, as if to impress everyone. This print out, I assume to prove to us that he went to law school, was just a paper with the first like, five U.S. amendments. He then proceeded to tell us stuff such as:

-Stay away from Lemonade because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll dehydrate you.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI have been around places where a lot of big movies have been filmed.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI was a quarterback. You know what that is? You have to be real smart to be a QB. Its like being the director of a movie, you know, you have to know everything.‚Äù
-‚ÄúMy parents, real short people, are just two dumble-dees.‚Äù (Yes. Dumbledees. He then clarified that they were, and I kid you not ‚Äúreal dumb-dumbs.)
-Despite his opinion on lemonade, he kept talking about how he dipped, and this it would never negatively impact him. 

He was up his own butt the whole time about how smart he was, and even went on talking about how he was the Only Good Guy in the World, and that he was better than other people because he wasn‚Äôt ever going to get married(???) 
All of this talking, at the front desk of a hotel from about 10:20 till 11:10 or so. Trying so hard to impress the poor girl there. He would not go away despite her initially giving very clear signs (telling him she‚Äôs very busy, that she isn‚Äôt allowed to make friends at work, etc.) and obvious signs (in a half-joking tone telling him to go to his room, and to go away because she is busy.) 

How do I know it was him? Well, other than him saying he was a pro football player from Miami, that he went to law school, he was from North Carolina, and that he also played baseball and basketball in the past, he also just flat out looked like every image of Garrison Lassiter than came up when I punched in those keywords. Kinda tall, in his 30‚Äôs or so, indiscernible hairline, and just his face in general. Oddly enough though, he didn‚Äôt talk much about baseball, and instead went on more about football and being a lawyer who definitely worked some very serious and secret cases. 

I know you have no reason to believe this story, or believe that it was indeed Garrison, but I know it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs a very true, very real, EXTREMELY, UNBEARABLY ANNOYING experience. This man was pretty creepy, but far worse, he was impossibly annoying and bizarre. And once again, to clarify, all of this is alleged. I know nothing about sports, or any of his affairs.

"Think about it. Minorities don‚Äôt know how to get ids or they can‚Äôt afford it. If they can‚Äôt get ids then they can‚Äôt get the vaccine. If they can‚Äôt get the vaccine then they shouldn‚Äôt go to a local game. 

Therefore MLB should allow everyone to watch local games live on the app.

"If I was in charge of a television station that was airing baseball games, I would get rid of the arrow that either points up or down for the inning. And here‚Äôs why...

No self respecting baseball fan should need an arrow telling them if it‚Äôs the top or bottom of the 3rd. Just put the number of the inning and let the viewers mind work for a little bit instead of spoon feeding information.  Every baseball fan should know which stadium they‚Äôre playing at by looking at the field, the players, the jerseys, and in some cases by the announcers. 

For those who don‚Äôt know stadiums, players and teams... play better. Start studying.",mlb

So I recently have gotten into baseball again and i want to watch my hometown Anaheim Angels. How could I watch them besides when they place the team that is closest to where I live now?,mlb
"As somebody who doesn‚Äôt follow baseball anymore, but who splurged on gamepass and had an open weekend, I decided to download the new MLB The Show 21 and give it a try. The last baseball game I played was Ken Griffery Jr Presents on N64, so it has been a while. 

Here are some of the things I learned while playing this game:

1)	I don‚Äôt know any baseball players.

When I checked the rosters, I realized I know about five baseball players who currently play the game. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised as I don‚Äôt watch baseball, but it still hit home that very few baseball players break through the sports news cycle enough to penetrate a casual sport fan‚Äôs skull. I listen to sports radio and watch football, basketball, soccer, and golf. 
When I created a player for the Road to the Show mode, I didn‚Äôt even remember which divisions were which, but I knew enough to play in the NL so I could be a true two-way player and both pitch and bat. When you create a player, you can choose their player motions which is really cool. You can choose your batting stance, pitching motion, homerun trot and celebration, and more. While I couldn‚Äôt use any current players for this without just scrolling through each option, I could choose former players. So, if I wanted to pitch like Greg Maddux and hit like Griffey, those were options on the list. Very cool!

2)	The announcing is both awesome and terrible.

When you create a player you can input your first and last name. There are an obnoxious amount of names which have the sound already recorded. Not only did my real name work awesomely and stroke my little video game ego, but Mike Hunt worked, and my personal favorite of Victor Victor Victor (first name Victor Victor, last name Victor) was also satisfying.

Of course, once you are in the game hearing these names you giggle occasionally and listen to the broadcast as the announcing team chugs on play by play. Most of it is awesome. Most of it. They will share stats and be in awe of your twenty-game hitting streak, they will wax poetic about your pitches and how it is affecting the game. They really do an excellent job.

But some of it is also baffling, and it might just be because the game is so new and there are bugs. One in particular comment has happened to me about fifty times and I am forced to scream at the tv each time. My pitcher throws roughly 85% strikes. After playing my first season I had hundreds of strike outs and a couple perfect games, and exactly ZERO walks. That doesn‚Äôt stop one of these blowhards, pretty much every game seemingly, from commenting about how my pitcher has an interesting style but unfortunately OFTEN WALKS PEOPLE. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED ONCE. REMOVE IT FROM THE ROTATION, FELLAS.

I understand with so many games and at bats everything will get repetitive, but this has been my biggest gripe.

3)	It is really user friendly.

When you first start the game you go through a tutorial of the various ways you can pitch, hit, field, etc. While some of the ways are bafflingly difficult, if you try them all you will find the way you like. I made it pretty close to the controls I remember from KGJP64, so I didn‚Äôt need to learn how to play a baseball game all over again. The difficulty can be made to scale with your skill. This makes it so the first few games are quite easy, but then things start to flow better about halfway through the season. In the end I settled on a medium difficulty and was hitting mid .300s in the minors and striking out about 10 players a game, which I think is about right. I haven‚Äôt made it to the majors yet, but when I do I will increase the difficulty one more level to make it realistic if the game doesn‚Äôt on its own.

4)	It has good pacing.

I was most concerned about how much time I would have to dedicate to a baseball game. When I played KGJP64 I would need a good half hour to play a nine-inning game. Multiply that by 160ish or whatever and I am not going to complete a season. In the Show, however, pitching a game usually takes 10-15 minutes, and playing the field and batting can be as little as 5. If you are the DH, maybe even 3. This made it so I could play a whole season in one weekend, which is awesome. It might have just been my settings or something, and of course I skipped to where my player was active only, but the pacing made this a much more enjoyable experience than I was expecting.

5)	Your player is so customizable.

Equipment, skill cards and loadouts, appearance, motions. You can be whoever you want to be game to game. I made a 5‚Äô5 switch-hitting lefty who can throw 100 and steal second every time. I made a 6‚Äô10 giant who hits a homer a game and throws exclusively knuckle pitches. I made me, as I am unfortunately neither of those people. And you can change from your speed pitching to your power hitting to your base running to your curve throwing to your fielding guru all from game to game. This made Road to the Show a really enjoyable time.

6)	Who the fuck is Christopher Russo and why won‚Äôt he shut the fuck up?

So, when you are drafted you get these MLB Network segments that are broad enough to make it seem like they are talking about you. Just like the announcing, they aren‚Äôt always perfect but they are a good listen at least the first time through. Then there is the Christopher Russo dude who just seems like a prick who likes being a prick. I skip him every time now.

Shut the fuck up, Christopher Russo. Shut the fuck up.


In short, even as somebody who no longer follows baseball, MLB the Show 21 is a particularly good time. By playing I have learned some new players and when I get to the majors I will probably see who the stars are and it may even help me get back into the game. While I only play the Road to the Show mode, I unlocked a bunch of players which I can only assume are for some kind of Ultimate Team online mode. I might take a look at that mode, but I am wary. I have yet to bounce a curve ball two feet in front of the plate because I am not an asshole and the computer wouldn‚Äôt swing at it anyway, and I have a feeling online will be mostly that. But, even so, I think The Show will stay in my gaming rotation for a while.",mlb

"I'm planning to make the trip to Fenway in September for my first (and perhaps last) baseball game there. I thought that it'd enhance the experience to watch the Red Sox and Yankees rivalry, but it's another $200+ per ticket than when the Red Sox Play the Mets earlier in the same week. Seeking opinions here: if you could only see a game at Fenway one time, would you pay extra to see the rivalry? Is there something else I should be considering? I feel like either NY team has a chance of being competitive at the end of the year. Thanks!",mlb

"Hey All. I'm a New England guy (northern New England), and like most people from northern New England, I love the Red Sox and hate the Yankees. I've long wanted to follow a National League team, but I've never been able to pick one. 

The closest NL team is the New York Mets, which isn't terrible, but it's kind of weird to root for a New York team when I'm an all-Boston-sports guy. The next closest team is the Phillies. The Blue Jays are closer than most of the other teams (other than those mentioned previously), but that's an AL team. The Expos would have been only a few hours away, but they no longer exist. My grandmother, a big baseball fan, grew up a Boston Braves fan, so Atlanta has always been interesting, but they are really far away, obviously, and aren't on TV locally anymore (since the end of the TBS deal).

So, I guess the teams that make the most sense (which isn't saying much, I know) are the Mets and Phillies, because they are somewhat within driving distance, the Braves, and at that point, it's really a toss-up. Any ideas, thoughts, opinions? Any other recommendations? 

I know it's a weird question, but if you can't ask this sort of thing here, then where the heck can you?",mlb

After a team gets 3 hits in a row they're should be a fun ball time! The ump throws out the 2020 funballs and the pitcher has to use those until he gets an out. Like a bonus or something. And if a pitcher strikes out 3 in a row he's allowed to bean the first batter in the next inning he pitches....with them announcing they used 2 different weighted balls its already there. Also lets do universal DH and that player can use steroids and Adderall.,mlb

"Basically, I wonder if any given batter has a better chance of getting hit in their first try against the same pitcher or in a second or third go-around until the bullpen comes in.

I can't find anything here or on pro baseball reference that points to it and that could really be interesting to prove or disprove whether it's better to pull a starter on the first cycle of the batting order once a certain number of hits are on the board.

Off the top of my head, I feel as if it has to rise cumulatively as the hitter gets more used to the pitch selection but this could be one of those counterintuitive things where they actually do better on the first frame.",mlb

"Mickey Mantle CF, 1B (1951-1968)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, Triple Crown, 20x all star, 7x World Series champion, Gold Glove, Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn‚Äôt find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

vs

Ken Griffey Jr CF (1989-2010)

Career accolades: hall of fame, MVP, 13x all star, 10x gold glove, 7x silver slugger, AS MVP

Career stats: 83.8WAR, .284/.370/.538, 2781 hits, 630HRs, 1836RBIs, 184SBs, 5271TBs

Career highlight: going back to back with his dad. 

Best season (1997): .304/.382/.646, 185 hits,  56HRs, 147RBIs, 15SBs

Fun feat: Griffey was the first member of the HoF to hit 40 homers in both the AL (Mariners) and NL (Reds)

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it‚Äôd be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player. If you had the blessing of watching him you knew there was never a boring moment. Iconic is the word to describe him.

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth‚Äôs home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth‚Äôs record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I‚Äôm his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career.

vs

Babe Ruth OF, SP (1914-1935)

Career accolades: Hall of Fame, MVP, 2x all star, 7x World Series champion, batting title, ERA title

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today.

I'm a Mets fan and I remember being excited when he signed.  He played great....then they traded him back to the Dodgers.  I know the team stunk and they were dumping everyone.  How on earth did he clear waivers, someone on a 1 year deal hitting over .300 at the time?",mlb

Based on career averages right now, he‚Äôs still significantly worse than Williams and Babe Ruth 

It‚Äôs also important to note that Trout hasn‚Äôt had his down years yet. Pujols had a 170 OPS+ in STL and now has a career 144. Trout‚Äôs career averages will most likely drop as well, putting him farther behind.

Degrom has a similar story

Degrom 157   1261.2 innings 
Kershaw 155  2454.2 innings 
Pedro 154       2827.2 innings 

While Degrom has a higher ERA+ he also has thrown significantly fewer innings. As he continues to pitch and gets injured and worn down his career averages will get worse. 

Kershaw‚Äôs ERA+ for the last 4 years are 142, 137, 202(shortened season), 115
 
Pedro‚Äôs ERA+ for his last 3 seasons with at least 100 innings were 75, 146, 124.

Fun feat: Griffey was the first member of the HoF to hit 40 homers in both the AL (Mariners) and NL (Reds)

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it‚Äôd be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player. If you had the blessing of watching him you knew there was never a boring moment. Iconic is the word to describe him.

"Hey guys! If you guys would be so kind as to fill out this survey for me it would be much appreciated. This is for a uni class, it's not being used for any business purpose, but as genuinely and accurately as you can answer would be great. There are no right or wrong answers, it's all your opinion, however try to stay away from extremes such as answering ones or sevens across the board.

The questions are mainly about Joe Buck and John Smoltz as a commentary team, and what kind of factors you like in a commentary team and/or broadcast. All questions are multiple choice, the whole thing should take no more than a couple minutes. Thank you!

No way are Yankee fans still considering Correa after what he said about the golden boy. I do however 100% agree with his comments. Jeter was overrated and was never the best shortstop in the league any year he played.,mlb

However, from what I remember when Jeter retired it was like Gretzky or Jordan retired. Everybody loved him, no one had anything bad to say. Now I keep seeing in sports pages comments how Jeter is incredibly overrated and some MLB player said he didn‚Äôt deserve any of his awards.

"Mickey Mantle CF, 1B (1951-1968)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, Triple Crown, 20x all star, 7x World Series champion, Gold Glove, Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn‚Äôt find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

vs

Nolan Ryan SP (1966-1993)

Career accolades: 8x all star, World Series champion, 2x ERA Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 81.3WAR, 3.19ERA, 5714Ks (record), 1.25WHIP, 6.6H/9

Career highlight: throwing 7 no hitters

Best season (1973): 21-16, 2.87ERA, 382Ks, 1.23WHIP, 6.6H/9, 10.6K/9

Fun feat: despite being arguably the greatest pitcher of all time Nolan never received the Cy Young award even losing it to his teammate Mike Scott

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well‚Ä¶ except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he‚Äôs the perfect pitcher

Hank Aaron RF, 1B (1954-1976)

career accolades: MVP, World Series Champion, 25x all star, 2x batting title, 3x gold glove, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth‚Äôs home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth‚Äôs record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I‚Äôm his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career.

vs

Ted Williams LF (1939-1960)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 2x Triple Crown, 19x all star, 6x all star, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn‚Äôt technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn‚Äôt swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book ‚ÄúThe Science of Hitting‚Äù which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field.

"Babe Ruth OF, SP (1914-1935)

Career accolades: Hall of Fame, MVP, 2x all star, 7x World Series champion, batting title, ERA title

Career hitting stats: 183.1WAR, .342/.474/.690 (SLG record), 2873 hits, 714HRs, 2214RBIs, 123SBs

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today. There‚Äôs a reason every player gets compared to him because there‚Äôs none other like the Babe

"Mariano Rivera CP (1995-2013)

Career highlight: being the only unanimous hall of famer

Best season (2005): 1.38ERA, 43-47 in saves, 80Ks

Fun feat: Rivera has more saves then fellow HoFers Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage combined

Analysis: for many positions you can make an argument for different players as the greatest but when it comes to the greatest closer ever you can only have one name. Rivera is the best closer of all time while only throwing one pitch. His cutter was a nightmare for opposing hitters and any time he came in you could stop watching cause the game was over but you‚Äôd miss one of the best pitchers ever.

Career stats: 127.3WAR, .358/.434/.577, 2930 hits, 301HR, 1584RBIs, 135SBs

Career highlight: hitting .397 in a 5 year span from 1920-1925

Best season (1922): .401/.459/.722, 250 hits, 42HRs, 152RBIs

Fun feat: Hornsby is the only player to win the NL Triple Crown twice

Analysis: Roger is the Ty Cobb of the NL if there ever was one the difference is Hornsby had the pop that Cobb lacked in his bat. A man that was obsessed with hitting he made it his goal to be the best hitter every season he could be. He even refused to read newspapers or go out so he could focus on hitting and this worked as Hornsby owns the highest single season batting average outside the dead ball era. He was a solid fielder at second as well but at the plate he excelled.

Best season (1997): .304/.382/.646, 185 hits,  56HRs, 147RBIs, 15SBs

Fun feat: Griffey was the first member of the HoF to hit 40 homers in both the AL (Mariners) and NL (Reds)

Career highlight: Hitting 4 home runs in a single game

Best season (1927): .373/.474/.765, 218 hits, 47HR, 173RBIs, 52 doubles

Fun fact: Lou was the first athlete to appear on a box of wheaties 

Analysis: Lou was the robin to the Babes Batman who blossomed into the Nightwing of the team. One of the men that paved the way for the hard hitting first baseman he batted like only few in the league at the time. Gehrig was a great hitter with good defense at first and a cornerstone for the Yankees dynasty and a legend for more than just his on field skills

Cal Ripken Jr. SS, 3B (1981-2001)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, ROTY, 19x all star, World Series champion, 2x gold glove, 8x silver slugger, 2x AS MVP

Career stats: 95.9WAR, .276/.340/.447, 3184 hits, 431HRs, 1695RBIs, 5186TBs

Career highlight: breaking Lou Gehrigs consecutive game streak

Best season (1991): 11.5WAR (most by a SS), .323/.374/.567, 210 hits, 34HRs, 114RBIs

Fun feat: there is a conspiracy that the orioles faked an electrical issue so Cal could keep his game streak alive

Analysis: Cal may not have been one of the most consistent hitters to play the game but his longevity of playing and his glove at short made him a valuable player. Cal was reliable to play and play well. He was never a liability and his best years at the plate made him one of the best SS of all time.

"Hey all, 

I am relatively new to watching MLB, generally being an NFL fan, and I have a few questions regarding the draft because I had heard during a World Series game that one of the pitchers was a 19th-round pick. 

1) Why are there so many rounds in the MLB draft? Given that it has fewer teams and fewer starting players than the NFL, what's the reason for this? 

2) What positions generally go first in the MLB draft and why?

3) Since there are MLB and then the minor leagues, do drafted players automatically go to MLB teams and are immediate starters?

4) If players didn't play in the college sytems, are they free to sign with any team or would they also have to go through the draft? 

5) How popular is the draft among MLB fans? Do MLB fans follow college baseball and anticipate the draft as rabidly as NFL fans? 

6) What other things are there that the average MLB viewer should know about the draft?",mlb

Fun feat: Jackie broke the color barrier in major league sports in 1947 which is the most fun feat a player could do literally changing history

Analysis: Jackie is a great player, there are some under the assumption that he was overrated but his stats are great especially in his prime he was a spectacle to watch playing the game quickly with his steal of home being a moment in history you still show people today. He was a player good enough to play against players who hated him and to succeed with all the pressure put on him it shows the true value Jackie brought to the sport

"Buster Posey is a very good player but he is also being overhyped. I believe this is due to his 3 WS rings. During those 3 WS he had a negative WPA in the 2010 and 2014 WS. 

He also received many of his major awards in his great 2012 season in which he won his MVP, HA award, SS, and batting title. But other than that year all he has is 3 SS and 1 GG for individual awards.

**NOTE: Not guaranteeing that this will happen. This is just a hypothetical.**

&amp;#x200B;

**TRANSITIONS:**

Late 2021/Early 2022:

At the 11-hour, the Oakland Athletics, Oakland City Council along with Alameda County work together to come to an agreement on financing and infrastructure and Howard Terminal gets built.

&amp;#x200B;

2022:

The Cleveland Indians become the Cleveland Guardians.

The Universal DH and new salary floor is agreed upon between the owners and MLBPA in exchange for a 12-team postseason with 6 teams in each league qualifying.

&amp;#x200B;

2028:

After the Tampa Bay Rays split season proposal to split time between Tampa and Montreal fails, Stu Stenberg gets fed up and sells the Tampa Bay Rays entirely to Stephen Bronfman. The teams is then moved full-time to Montreal, QC and rebranded as the Montreal Expos.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2 Expansion Teams:

Nashville Stars - (Music City Baseball group ownership)

Portland Beavers - (Portland Diamond Project Group ownership)

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REALIGNMENT FOR 2028:**

&amp;#x200B;

With 32 teams, the MLB would likely want 8 4-team divisions in realignment.

**AMERICAN LEAGUE**

|AL EAST|AL NORTH|AL SOUTH|AL WEST|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|

&amp;#x200B;

2028:

In another new CBA, MLBPA, the MLB and owners would agree to have the regular season reduced when the league is expanded. Also a new TV deal will be reached. The number they will end of settling on is 154 games. By doing this, each team would be guaranteed at least 1 day of a week. They would also agree that the players would not have to take a pay cut for having reduced the schedule to 154 games.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REGULAR SEASON SCHEDULE FORMULA:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Divisional Play:**

18 games each vs. all 3 divisional opponents = 54 games

(Three 3-Game Series Home and Three 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Non Divisional Play Within League:**

6 games each vs. all 12 non-divisional opponents within league = 72 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Interleague Play:**

6 games each vs. all 4 interleague opponents from 1 assigned interleague division = 24 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs each team)

Assigned interleague divisions will rotate annually (4-year cycle). All 4 teams in a division would be assigned the same interleague division.

&amp;#x200B;

4 games vs. interleague ""natural"" rival = 4 games

(One 2-Game Series Home and One 2-Game Series Away).

Would be play on Thursday-Sunday directly after the All-Star break in Mid-July. Thursday and Friday at one ballpark and then Saturday and Sunday at the opposite ballpark.

(Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**54 games + 72 games + 24 games + 4 games = 154-game regular season**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON:**

&amp;#x200B;

In the new CBA after expansion, 12 teams (6 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners plus 2 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

"Ted Williams LF (1939-1960)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 2x Triple Crown, 19x all star, 6x all star, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn‚Äôt technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn‚Äôt swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book ‚ÄúThe Science of Hitting‚Äù which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field.

Ichiro RF (2001-2019)

Career accolades: MVP, Rookie of the Year, 10x all star, 3x silver slugger, 2x batting title, AS MVP

Career stats: 60WAR, .311/.355/.402, 3089 hits, 117HRs, 780RBIs, 509SBs, 3994TBs

Career highlight: Having the most hits in baseball history when combining his stats from MLB and NPB (Japan)

Best season (2001): .350/.381/.457, 242 hits, 8HRs, 56SBs, 69RBIs, MVP (honorable mention to 2004 which may be his greatest individual season but Ichiros accolades and impact on the mariners in ‚Äò01 puts this season on top)

Fun feat: Ichiro became the second player ever to win MVP as a rookie

Analysis: Ichiro is one of the most talented players to step on the field boasting the hitting ability of Pete Rose with plus talent in all aspects of the game even boasting he could hit 40 home runs but felt getting on base helped his team more. He is the baseball home run king when combining his hits in Japan and America he has more hits than Pete Rose and was a threat in two major leagues. Ichiro was fun to not only watch but to be around for his teammates having a great personality and enjoying every moment of the game.

"Tony Gwynn RF (1982-2001)

Career Accolades: 15x all star, 5x gold glove, 7x silver slugger, 8x batting title, hall of fame

Career stats: 69.2WAR, .338/.388/.459, 3141 hits, 135HRs, 1138RBIs, 319SBs, 543 doubles, 85 triples

Career Highlight: nearly achieving a .400 batting average before the lockout ended the season. 

Best season: 1987: .370/.447/.511, 218 hits, 56SBs. Honorable mention to the strike shortened season of ‚Äò94 where Gwynn ended with a batting average of .397

Analysis: In a time where the league started moving toward power and the long ball Gwynn showed up and did what he did best. Hit. Gwynn was a prolific contact hitter almost hitting .400 where he would have been the first to do it since Ted Williams. His hitting prowess almost guaranteed him to be a threat at the plate with his speed to cause chaos on the base baths Gwynn succeeded and is an epitome of a great lead off hitter. Another thing Gwynn had to boast was his ability to play the field. Gwynn was a 5x gold glover and with his speed could chase down any ball into the gap.

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth‚Äôs record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment.

"Last night was the first time I have watched a Home Run Derby in many years. I honestly don't remember the last one I watched, if I had to guess I would say it has been at least 20 years since I have watched one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I watched it on the MLB site, I am not sure if that was the same coverage as what aired on ESPN. I would guess it was a little different because I was able to see most of the hits that the guy (I forget him name) who went against Alonzo in the first round but apparently on ESPN they showed very little of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoyed watching it. It was entertaining, fun and seemed to be a real contest throughout the whole thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I couldn't help but notice is that this is an event where the bracket set up is completely unnecessary. I think it would have made for a much better event if they just let all 8 people hit, the four with the highest number of home runs advanced to the next round, then the top two. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing I thought is that the tie breaker, instead of being three pitches should have been a three ""out"" tie breaker where any thing that is not a home run counted as an out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few observations from someone who hasn't watched in many years. Overall, it was a very fun thing to watch. Looking forward to the game tonight!",mlb

"Quotes from him:

&gt;The fact that you have a foreign player that doesn‚Äôt speak English, that needs an interpreter, believe it or not ‚Äî I think contributes to harming the game to some degree when that‚Äôs your box office appeal. It needs to be somebody like Bryce Harper, Mike Trout ‚Äî those guys. And unfortunately, at this moment in time, that‚Äôs not the case.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Baseball was dying in the 90s. What saved it? It was the home run competition between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Obviously Sammy Sosa, we learned later during his testimony on Capitol Hill, that suddenly he needed an interpreter. You know, ‚Äòbaseball been very very good to him,‚Äô you know what I‚Äôm saying? That wasn‚Äôt enough. He needed an interpreter to speak for him when he was on Capitol Hill. He certainly didn‚Äôt need that when he was smacking those home runs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But Mark McGwire basically helped save baseball, because you had a dude that you could put on Wheaties boxes, alright? That can ingratiate himself with the younger generations out there, and had America transfixed on the sport of Major League Baseball. What I‚Äôm saying is, that‚Äôs not the case. I‚Äôm not taking anything away from Ohtani ‚Äî I know what he‚Äôs doing on the field, I know it‚Äôs nothing short of spectacular, and I understand that baseball is an international sport itself in terms of participation ‚Äî but when you talk about an audience gravitating to the tube, to the ballpark, to actually watch you, I don‚Äôt think it helps that the number one face is a dude that needs an interpreter so you can understand what thell he‚Äôs saying.

I'm a bit surprised there isn't more backlash on this forum, or really much of anywhere on Reddit. It seems pretty cut and dry a racist, xenophobic rant from someone who's had some [awful takes in the past](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/07/29/espn-suspends-stephen-a-smith-for-one-week-after-he-repeatedly-made-inflammatory-comments-about-domestic-abuse/).

"So we‚Äôre at the All-star break and things aren‚Äôt looking great. Obviously the season is far from over. I feel like this team has a lot of talent. We should remember that the nationals overcame a much bigger deficit in 2019. So why can‚Äôt the Yankees? They have the 10th best ERA with a solid bullpen as well. But are ranked 23rd in Runs. They don‚Äôt do well enough with runners in scoring position. Cashman claims they‚Äôre going to be buyers. I want to see what you all think about my belief in these 3 players they should go for.

Firstly, I think they should think about whit merrifield. He can play a lot of positions. I know he‚Äôs another righty but he leads the league in stolen bases and will bunt. I feel like he can be a DJ with speed. Overall, he would bring something different to the lineup which they need. And most importantly, I don‚Äôt think they have to give up as much as the next 2 players I‚Äôll talk about. Maybe they‚Äôll trade Voit and move DJ to third, put Gleyber back at second and whit can play SS. 

My next 2 players are outfielders so it would be interesting to see what the yanks would do. I think Jesse winker would be nice. He‚Äôs a powerful lefty who can bat for average and would love the short porch (they desperately need a solid lefty in this lineup). I feel like his main issue may be his defense though. 

I also like Joey Gallo. I think they would need to give up more for him because he‚Äôs a Jesse Winker with more power. He can easily hit at least 20 homers at Yankee stadium and has a cannon of an arm. Maybe they‚Äôll move him to LF and keep Judge in right. If I‚Äôm not mistaken he can play third and first base as well. 

Overall, I can be wrong about what I‚Äôm thinking. And there‚Äôs plenty of other guys they can go after, like Jose Berrios. Like I said at the beginning though they have solid pitching so I think they should focus on offense. Other notable mentions for offensive production would be Javier Baez, Matt Chapman, and Trevor Story. Who knows what will happen. Maybe my beliefs are wrong but I feel like they‚Äôre pretty reasonable. Sorry I wrote such a long post! Thank you to whoever read the whole thing. I‚Äôm interest in what y‚Äôall think.",mlb

"in case anybody hasn't seen it Stephen a smith had this to say on Ohtani, 

&gt;*But when you talk about an audience gravitating to the tube or to the ballpark to actually watch you, I don‚Äôt think it helps that the number one face is a dude that needs an interpreter so you can understand what the hell he‚Äôs saying*

He then goes on to say that if this was bryce harper we'd be talking about baseball 5 days a week.

My problem with what Stephen A said is that even if ohtani knew english, there wouldnt be that much difference in the viewership of MLB. Theyd just find another excuse to say why they don't watch Ohtani (he plays in the west coast, he's too quiet, etc). We had never seen a guy as consistent as Trout and that didn't attract alot of people. Stanton almost hit 60 one year and that didn't attract anybody. Look at what the padres and tatis are doing, Tatis knows english and I don't hear them talking about the Padres. The dodgers vs Padres is the most interesting rivalry in years, they haven't talked about it either. The problem i feel stephen a doesn't understand is that the best way to attract people to watch something is to have someone that the people can relate to. If there is someone from your home state county or town that become somewhat famous (sports, tv, etc) it will cause you to want to watch what this person might become and watch a little more because there is a sense of pride when someone from your area is doing big things. Even if it's a sport you never watch. Every single person feels this way, its a weird subconscience thing I feel like humans have. THere is a basketball player in the NBa who is from my town and he is in a team I rarelyh follow, but the fact that he is from my town ill watch that team just to see how he does. And this is a guy who barely gets minutes. My point is even if Ohtani knew english, since Americans don't feel they can relate to him there wouldn't be that much difference in interest whether he knew english or not.

One thing I slightly agree with Stephen A is, that knowing english would make ohtani more marketable. He already is very marketable, but I think he's be in more national commercials. I know spanish and to be honest sometimes the translators do a poor job at translating word for word what was said. For other languages, I sometimes wonder if the translator is doing his word justice. One person I feel like missed on alot of money was Bartolo Colon beacuse of this. Remember Big Sexy, if Bartolo had done more commercials during that time he would've made so much money. I know he did a few afterwords like the coal commercial and he had one too this year, but he'd be featured in more commercials if he knew english.

"TLDR: There should be more teams in the MLB to fix attendance and interest in the sport. The locations of the teams now leave huge markets in pro-baseball deserts and blackout restrictions make it impossible for large groups of people to watch a team that represents them even remotely. With a team in driving distance, more people would attend the games and take interest in the sport as a whole. 

So, attendance has been miserable in recent years. More and more people seem to be losing interest in the game. They've implemented all sorts of changes to the ball, the bats, the pitchers, etc. to try and make the game more competitive and exciting. They may or may not have succeeded in that but the problem remains. I think the solution is relatively simple and I want to know if I'm missing something obvious. 

Here it is:
There should be ten more teams in the MLB, spread out across the country. With fewer teams than there are in the NFL but with ten times the number of games, entire markets are being missed. The southeast, outside of Florida, has essentially one team to go see, the Atlanta Braves. The northeast has the Seattle Mariners and no one else until San Francisco. I live in North Carolina and would have to drive 5 hours to go see the nearest MLB game. With 162 games in the year, the average baseball fan isn't going to drive 5 hours to see a singular game that, let's be honest, holds little significance on its own for the overall season. Hell, I don't even make the drive and I would consider myself one of the committed fans (though, my team isn't the Braves.) 
On top of that, if you want to stream the game, you're fighting blackouts all over. I know this is a contractual thing with cable, but again, in North Carolina there are 4 teams that are blacked out online, 3 of which don't actually get broadcast on cable. So, if I'm going to watch the most local MLB game, I'll have to either drive 5 hours or pay cable's exorbitant prices to get one team before adding on a baseball package. 
It just seems to me there are massive groups in this country that are in pro-baseball deserts, and to reach them, the best option would be to give them a local team they can actually reach to have pride in.",mlb

Fun feat: despite being arguably the greatest pitcher of all time Nolan never received the Cy Young award even losing it to his teammate Mike Scott

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well‚Ä¶ except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he‚Äôs the perfect pitcher

Pete Rose OF, 1B, 3B (1963-1986)

Career accolades: MVP, ROTY, 17x all star, 3x World Series Champion, 2x gold glove, Silver Slugger, World Series MVP, 3x Batting Title

Career stats: 79.6WAR, .303/.375/.409, 4256 hits, 160HRs, 198SBs, 1314RBIs

Career highlight: breaking Ty Cobb‚Äôs hit record

Best season (1973): .338/.401/.437, 230 hits, 5HRs, 64RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Rose is the only player in MLB history to play 500 games at 5 different positions. Those being 1B, 2B, 3B, LF and RF

Analysis: Pete Rose is like if you took Ty Cobb and placed him in the 60-80s. He was a hitters hitter and could see the ball like no one at the time. Charlie Hustle worked his butt off day in and day out as he perfected his hitting mechanics and obsessed with eclipsing Cobbs record. He was valuable at multiple positions while knowing the ins and outs of the game so well he become a manager. Pete was the real deal you can bet on that.

"Cy Young SP (1890-1911)

Career accolades: Triple Crown, World Series Champion, 2x ERA Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 163.6WAR, 2.63ERA, 511 wins (record), 815GS (record), 749CG (record), 1.13WHIP

Career highlight: never winning a Cy Young award‚Ä¶ BUT HAVING THE AWARD NAMED AFTER HIM. Holds the records for wins, losses, games started and complete games

Best season (1901): 33-10, 1.62ERA, 38CG, 5SHO, 158Ks

Fun feat: contrary to todays warmup methods and prep to start Cy said he never stretched and would warm up just 3 minutes before the game. 

Analysis: Cy pitched in a time where hitting was not a strong suit for players in the majors but that does not take away his feats. He would pitch complete games and be good to go 130+ pitches deep into games. He had the longevity to mow down batters and would finish most games he started. What holds Cy back is the age he played in but his success cannot be argued. 

vs

Jackie Robinson 2B, 3B, 1B (1945-1956)

Career accolades: MVP, ROTY, 7x all star, World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 63.9WAR, .313/.410/.477, 1563 hits, 200SBs, 141HRs, 761RBIs

Career highlight: breaking the color barrier in professional sports and his biggest in game moment. Stealing home in the World Series

Best season (1949): .342/.432/.528, 203 hits, 16HRs, 124RBIs, 37SBs

Fun feat: Jackie broke the color barrier in major league sports in 1947 which is the most fun feat a player could do literally changing history

Analysis: Jackie is a great player, there are some under the assumption that he was overrated but his stats are great especially in his prime he was a spectacle to watch playing the game quickly with his steal of home being a moment in history you still show people today. He was a player good enough to play against players who hated him and to succeed with all the pressure put on him it shows the true value Jackie brought to the sport

"Ty Cobb CF (1905-1928)

Career Accolades: MVP, Triple Crown, 12x Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 151.5WAR, .366/.433/.512, 4189 hits, 117HRs, 212SBs, 1944RBIs, 724 doubles

Career highlight: first ever person voted to the hall of fame with a 98.2% votes in

Best season (1911): .419/.466/.620, 248 hits, 127RBIs, 83SBs. 

Fun feats: Lead every offensive stat in the 1911 season besides home runs

Analysis: Ty Cobb is the start of the hard nose no nonsense player. A man who was said to fight fans and players a like he had the talent to earn him this respect as well. A man with the speed, contact and ability to hit the ball in the gap he was a threat all the time. He was a player that commanded respect and that was shown when he was the first man voted into the MLB Hall of Fame. 


vs

Warren Spahn SP (1942-1965)

Career accolades: Cy Young, 17x all star, World Series champion, 3x ERA title

Career stats: 100.1WAR, 3.09ERA, 2583Ks, 1.20WHIP

Career highlight: being apart of the ‚Äúbest pitched game in baseball‚Äù with Juan Marichal

Best season (1953): 23-7, 2.10ERA, 148Ks, 1.06WHIP

Fun feat: Spahn is the most winning left handed pitcher for his career

Analysis: Spahn was a pinnacle of pitching in the 50s being on the top of his game he valued wins more than any stat. He would pride himself in his ability to win. Spahn was a pitcher that would trip up many hitters possibly a 50s Greg Maddux forcing batters to hit ground balls instead of blowing balls by them

"Rickey Henderson LF (1979-2003)

Career accolades: MVP, 10x all star, 2x World Series Champion, Gold Glove, 3x silver slugger, ALCS MVP, hall of fame

Career stats: 111.2WAR, .279/.401/.419, 3055 hits, 297HR, 1406SBs, 2295 runs, 1115RBIs

Career highlight: eclipsing Lou Brock single season stolen base record and then going on to break his career stolen base record solidifying his record as near unbreakable

Best season: Rickey had many strong seasons breaking the single season steal record in 1982 but his best overall season may be 1985: .314/.419/.516, 172 hits, 24HRs, 72RBIs, 80SBs

Fun feat: Rickey‚Äôs (1st) distance between him and Lou Brock (2nd) for career steals is the same as Brock and Jimmy Rollins (47th)

Analysis: When people think of Rickey everyone thinks of his speed and think that is what he is all about but Rickey was a great player at the plate. In his time he was only 2nd to Barry Bonds in walks through that span And was a strong presence at the plate hitting .300 multiple times in his career. His speed gave him great range in the OF and his talents to find the gaps and pop a homer every so often made him a player who you look back and watch while looking at his stats and truly know we will never see a player like him again. 

vs

Mickey Mantle CF, 1B (1951-1968)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, Triple Crown, 20x all star, 7x World Series champion, Gold Glove, Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn‚Äôt find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

Career stats: 60WAR, .311/.355/.402, 3089 hits, 117HRs, 780RBIs, 509SBs, 3994TBs

Career highlight: Having the most hits in baseball history when combining his stats from MLB and NPB (Japan)

Best season (2001): .350/.381/.457, 242 hits, 8HRs, 56SBs, 69RBIs, MVP (honorable mention to 2004 which may be his greatest individual season but Ichiros accolades and impact on the mariners in ‚Äò01 puts this season on top)

Fun feat: Ichiro became the second player ever to win MVP as a rookie

Analysis: Ichiro is one of the most talented players to step on the field boasting the hitting ability of Pete Rose with plus talent in all aspects of the game even boasting he could hit 40 home runs but felt getting on base helped his team more. He is the baseball home run king when combining his hits in Japan and America he has more hits than Pete Rose and was a threat in two major leagues. Ichiro was fun to not only watch but to be around for his teammates having a great personality and enjoying every moment of the game. 

vs

Pedro Martinez SP (1992-2009)

Career accolades: 3x Cy Young, Triple Crown, 8x all star, World Series Champion, 5x ERA Title, AS MVP, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 83.9WAR, 2.93ERA, 3154Ks, 1.05WHIP, 7.1 h/9

Career highlight: between 1997-2003 Pedro had the best stretch of any pitcher with a 2.20ERA in 201 games

Best season (2000): 18-6, 1.74ERA, .73WHIP, 284Ks, 5.3H/9, 1.3BB/9

Fun feat: after winning his 200th game he had the best winning percentage of any pitcher all time

Analysis: Pedro is arguably the best pitcher of all time. His change up was near unhittable and with a great fastball to set it up and a repertoire that would make any hitter whiff he was the man you wanted on the mound at any time. His stretch from 97-03 is historic and being apart of the 04 Red Sox solidified him as a Boston Legend. He was gross to watch pitch striking out guys left and right he threw the ball as if it were on a string.

"Ted Williams LF (1939-1960)

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn‚Äôt technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn‚Äôt swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book ‚ÄúThe Science of Hitting‚Äù which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field. 

vs

Frank Thomas 1B, DH (1990-2008

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 5x all star, 4x silver slugger, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 73.8WAR, .301/.419/.555, 2468 hits, 521HRs, 1704RBIs, 4550 total bases

Career highlights: winning back to back MVPs in 1993 and 1994

Best season: 1994: .353/.487/.729, 141 hits, 34HRs, 101RBIs

Fun feat: Thomas‚Äô .487OBP was the highest in the AL since‚Ä¶ Ted Williams

Analysis: Frank is the epitome of a power bat that you want in your lineup. Where batters like Williams and Mays had the ability Frank also had the look. A tank of a man when he stepped up to the plate his sheer size struck fear into the hearts of pitchers. Add with that his capability to get the bat to the ball being a career .300 hitter Frank was not just a power bat he was a hitter. His downside is again his fielding capability. His size left him slow at first and being a career DH shows where his value was but as a pure hitter he was the man you wanted batting cleanup.

"Tony Gwynn RF (1982-2001)

Career stats: 69.2WAR, .338/.388/.459, 3141 hits, 135HRs, 1138RBIs, 319SBs, 543 doubles, 85 triples

Career Highlight: nearly achieving a .400 batting average before the lockout ended the season. 

Best season: 1987: .370/.447/.511, 218 hits, 56SBs. Honorable mention to the strike shortened season of ‚Äò94 where Gwynn ended with a batting average of .397

Analysis: In a time where the league started moving toward power and the long ball Gwynn showed up and did what he did best. Hit. Gwynn was a prolific contact hitter almost hitting .400 where he would have been the first to do it since Ted Williams. His hitting prowess almost guaranteed him to be a threat at the plate with his speed to cause chaos on the base baths Gwynn succeeded and is an epitome of a great lead off hitter. Another thing Gwynn had to boast was his ability to play the field. Gwynn was a 5x gold glover and with his speed could chase down any ball into the gap. 

vs

Honus Wagner SS, RF, 1B (1897-1917)

Career accolades: World Series Champion, 8x batting title, hall of fame

Career highlight: not a career highlight but having one of the rarest baseball card. As well he led the league in stolen bases and RBIs 5 times

Best season: 1908 (considered by win shares the greatest season of all time): .354/.415/.542, 201 hits, 53SBs, 109RBIs

Analysis: playing at a time where the ball would not leave the park as much Honus made it his job to get it in play and do damage. His RBI capability were great for the time as his contact allowed him to score anyone on the field while he possessed the ability to stretch a single into a double then steal third with ease. Wagner is more than his baseball card he is one of the greatest contact hitters with great field and a plus glove at short.

career accolades: MVP, World Series Champion, 25x all star, 2x batting title, 3x gold glove, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth‚Äôs home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth‚Äôs record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I‚Äôm his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career. 

vs

Greg Maddux SP (1986-2008)

Career accolades: 4x Cy Young, 8x all star, World Series Champion, 18x gold glover, 4x ERA title, hall of fame

Career stats: 106.6WAR, 3.16ERA, 355 wins, 109CG, 3371K‚Äôs, 35SHO

Career Highlight: 76 pitch complete game, having a stat named after him (a Maddux)

Best season: 1995: 19-2 record, 1.63ERA, 181Ks, .81WHIP, 6.7H/9, 1.4BB/9 (Cy Young)

Small analysis: arguably one of the best pitchers in the modern era Maddux made a name for himself not with high velo or strikeout potential but by daring you to hit the ball. Having one of the best sinker/cutter combos in the game with the command to put the ball wherever he wanted Maddux worked hitters with a lot of ground balls and keeping them on their toes by dotting them up. He is the greatest control pitcher of all time and in a world of flame throwers and strikeout pitchers Maddux made his money with control and command

"Pete Rose ""Charlie Hustle"" is the greatest baseball player of all time, in my opinion.  He played for 25 years, was an all-star 17 times, was in the top 10 for MVP voting 10 times and was MVP in 1973.  Rose is the overall hits leader all-time and is second for the most doubles.  He played 5 different positions and lead the league in fielding in 1970, 1974, 1976, and 1980. He won the World Series 3 times and won 3 batting titles.  

Nobody played the game harder.  Nobody played the game better.

If he had died in a car accident the night he retired from playing, he would be a shoe-in for the HOF and should be there as his playing career dictates.  He would be on my Mt. Rushmore of ballplayers.  If Baseball was a person, it would resemble the playing brilliance of Pete Rose.

"Watching the Angels and Blue Jays in extra innings right now. 

With the new rules, a runner starts on 2nd in extra innings. If you are the away team, pitching at the bottom of the inning, would it make sense to intentionally walk the first batter? Without regard to batting order considers. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you give up 1 or 2 runs. Now you give yourself an opportunity to turn 2, and a force out at 3rd.

- Jabbing each other in the ass with steroids for a decade or so to be The Bash Bortles or whatever it was
- Finding new substances so you can go on a year-long pursuit of a hallowed, hard-won American record that was built on nothing more than hard work, beer, hot dogs and venereal disease

"- Pitchers are only allowed 12 seconds to break between each pitch. 
- Once a batter gets to the plate he has 12 seconds to set in or either an out is added discounted etc. 
- Only 5 mound visits both sides per game 
- Keep 3 out 3 strike system.
Reduce the game to 6 innings. 

This will make each game under 2 hours and will keep the fun and accelerate pace

Also make sure to let players celebrate their home runs and tell the media announcers to make it seem memorable and not boring. Amp up the energy.

"*LOOKING TO HAVE A CIVIL CONVERSATION*

I am genuinely curious. I have been a Stros fan my whole life (I know, I know... my team cheated). But I have no clue why Altuve is the target for so many people.

Anyone that has actually followed his career knows that he is probably the most humble guy on the team. He has an amazing story of how he made it to the big leagues. I understand he got caught up in the cheating scandal, but is it understood that he had the lowest percentage of 'bangs' on the team? 2.7% of pitches thrown that to him that season. 22 (!!) out of 886 pitches that he saw. For reference, George Springer received 147 bangs. Even Carlos Correa (I know, another crowd favorite...) said that Altuve did not desire to receive bangs when hitting. The evidence clearly backs that up.

So, with all that being said, why is he the most hated? Is it because he's consistently a solid hitter which makes him an easy target? Is it because of the homerun off of Chapman? Do you all genuinely believe he was wearing a buzzer? Is it most mlb fans that hate him more than the rest of the Astros, or mainly Yankee/Dodger fans?

I realize that this post could seem like I am being hyper-defensive of Altuve. But please believe me when I say I am just simply looking to understand where the hate for him originates from.",mlb

"I've always been pretty ambivalent as to whether or not pitchers should wear head-gear.  I am in favor of independent decision making, so, I've tended to lean towards letting them decide for themselves.  Tonight, however, that all changed.  I was at a minor league game, Durham Bulls v. Norfolk Tide, and witnessed an awful injury.  The relief pitcher for the Bulls, Tyler Zombro, took an absolute rocket off of his head.  He collapsed in a heap and then had a seizure that seemed to last forever.  Just a terrible scene.  After this, I really think head protection for pitchers need to be mandated.  I am sure there was debate about helmets for batters and, now, its just custom.  I hope we will reach a point soon when protection for pitchers is just a normal part of the game.

But like his whole thing of taking like two minutes to round the base and like dancing before third is just getting kind of old.

Yeah it was cool when he did it in big moments against the Dodgers, but when it‚Äôs like a solo shot in the top of the third it just seems excessive and just not really fun. Like sometimes I think we have to save stuff for the true big moments.

"Not for his life because I‚Äôm not that type of person. But in a dark bar like I‚Äôm about to be. I hope there is a moment where he fears for his job, where he has the balls to emerge and say I fucked up. Except it feels like this will be swept under the rug. It‚Äôs felt like the machine that is MLB and it‚Äôs Media and Umpiring has been against us from the start . I don‚Äôt know the exact number Vegas was set to lose if the Dodgers were out and especially if the Giants won the whole thing, but it was substantial. Enough to throw a series? Absolutely and I can‚Äôt pretend I haven‚Äôt seen it before. Someone said it feels like 02 when the Kings were ousted by the Refs to make way for Kobe and Shaq. From the off, this game felt rigged. People don‚Äôt understand in this game a single bad call can skew entire at bats and innings. Take the 4th for example. It is extremely mentally hard borderline fucked to come back from an AB like Kris Bryant‚Äôs. Everyone saw that terrible umpiring and there was nothing we could do. The strong are able to say, hey it‚Äôs only the 4th, but for most that‚Äôs enough to kill a game.
This is part of the magic in baseball, of course. I‚Äôm not even advocating for robo umps. I like traditional baseball and we‚Äôve rode that magical wave all year. But this felt manipulative, the last pitch feels like Morales had to end that game while we could. For whatever reason, ie the sports book, the merchandising, the Dodgers 300 million payroll and corrupt city and state officials. 
Anyways, I‚Äôm smart enough to know I‚Äôll have to wash this off. My grandpa died 3 days ago at the age of 80 and he was a huge Giants fan. I was able to go to Game 1 and tell him I was there while he was in hospice care. I thought an extra angel in the outfield would be out there last night but it felt more like MLB cronies had their influence. The biased reporting after the fact and the callback to the completely irrelevant Ruf check swing feels like propaganda and brainwash. 
I have a funeral look forward to and no Giants baseball, that‚Äôs my problem. I‚Äôm not hurting in any weird ways, huge advocate for mental health here. This one stings however and I just wanted to write this.
Have a great day Giants fans. If you‚Äôre a real one Pat yourself on the back. And protect Doval!! 
Ps The mood of this whole thing may be inconsistent. I‚Äôm a writer, poems mostly, but I just don‚Äôt feel like  spending more time on this. Hope it is coherent enough . Our boys did good. Left too many runners all year",mlb

"‚ÄúThe Major League Baseball rulebook does not contain an official definition for a checked swing, but defines a swing as ""an attempt to strike at the ball"". It is the decision of the umpire as to whether an attempt was made or not. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls their wrists back are considered in the ruling. Some umpires prefer to use the ""breaking the wrists"" criterion as the method to decide a checked swing: if the wrists ""rolled over"", a swing occurred.‚Äù",mlb
It's way over do for baseball to change their playoff system.  The best teams in the league with the highest wins should have a chance to meet up in the championship series not the divisional series.  Its better for the fans and better for the game.  MLB should get this done in the winter.,mlb

"I know this is going to be a tired topic after tonight's game but let's be honest. SF vs LA NLDS, first time both teams faced one another in the playoffs with a 136 year rivalry in the rearview. Goes to game 5, a HOFer is on the bump against a team that beat all odds.

Yet this umpiring crew includes: Angel Hernandez, Doug Eddings, Ted Barrett and now, everyone's new  favorite (especially in the Bay Area) Gabe Morales.

Umpires can eject and subsequently even be the basis of a player being fined and suspended. When a player is playing horribly, they are subjected to being demoted and face internal scrutiny.

However, Morales can make that call during, without a doubt, the biggest game of this postseason and will only be faced by mean tweets and so forth. No fine, no demotion, nothing a player is dealt with in a similar position of disappointment.

If the MLB wants to garner more support in viewership and the Umpire Union wants to preserve their credibility, change the rules. Don't let Gabe officiate another game. Stop letting Angel officiate play off games (or MLB games in general). This is seriously insane. And the MLB wonders why this game is constantly bombarded with claims of it being archaic.",mlb

"With my team out of the playoffs for the 20th year, it's time to start thinking about the future of the sport. Once the stadium situations in Tampa and Oakland are figured out, the MLB will be looking to expand to 32 teams.

First of all, with how badly the city of Oakland handled the Raiders, I think the A's follow their football counterparts to Vegas. With that out of the way, I think the 2 expansion teams will be Portland (partly bias, since I live in the PNW) and Montreal, since they've had a team before. Here's how I see realignment going down:

AMERICAN LEAGUE:
EAST:
Baltimore Orioles
Boston Red Sox
Chicago White Sox
Cleveland Guardians
Detroit Tigers
New York Yankees
Tampa Bay Rays
Toronto Blue Jays

WEST:
Houston Astros
Kansas City Royals
Las Vegas Athletics
Los Angeles Angels
Minnesota Twins
Portland Beavers
Seattle Mariners
Texas Rangers

NATIONAL LEAGUE:
EAST:
Atlanta Braves
Cincinnati Reds
Miami Marlins
Montreal Expos
New York Mets
Philadelphia Phillies
Pittsburgh Pirates
Washington Nationals

WEST:
Arizona Diamondbacks
Chicago Cubs
Colorado Rockies
Los Angeles Dodgers
Milwaukee Brewers
San Diego Padres
San Francisco Giants
St. Louis Cardinals

I kept every team in the league they're currently in for simplicity. I also tried to keep divisional rivalries together. I'm sorry if I failed to keep your team with their rivals. I figure going to 8 team divisions would be better than 4 team divisions, because it simplifies the scheduling formula with 12 games against each divisional opponent, 7 games against each opponent in the other division in your league, 3 games against each opponent in one division in the other league, and 4 games against your interleague rival.

"I've had this idea for quite some time now. And with the new-age analytics and strategies, I have been pondering whether this idea would work or not. Personally, I believe it will not only work, but it will transform the game, altering how managers and GMs build rosters and select lineups.

The idea: Spread out the team's best batters, scattered (properly) throughout the lineup. Ideally (but obviously varying based on the team's uniqueness and talent) the lineup would be structured as below.

1. 6th best batter
2. 1st best batter
3. 2nd best batter

Now absorb the methodology behind tomorrow's roster. By scattering best hitters throughout, the lineup is now more well-rounded and provides for less holes. No more likely ""wasting"" 3 innings a game. This also causes the opposing team to make much more challenging decisions. No more handing the ball to the best guy in the bullpen to get the most challenging part of the order out.

Yes, I know there are two flaws that you archaic minds will refute with. Yes, I understand the purpose of putting your best hitters in the top of the order ensures that they get the maximum number of potential plate appearances. But another flaw people might call out is that this will lower the effectiveness of the top batters, as they can just get pitched around to face the next batter. In this instance though, teams will go through their lineup faster. Plus analytics knows that a successful plate appearance is one that results in someone getting on base, and this will continuously provide that, should opposing teams decide to pitch around the best players (I also believe that much like the death of bunting, pitchers will be less likely to intentionally walk batters, since the odds are in their favor that the batter will get out, no matter how talented the batter is they get out at least 70% of the time). But remember... in this order, there will be only one ""lesser batter"" generally for every two ""better batters.""

This system does provide a greater reliance from the ""lesser batters,"" however they are in the big leagues aren't they? At some points throughout the games/season they will come through. And if not, don't worry, you have another great batter coming up right after.

Let's hear the uproar in responses. You all can remember reading this post though, when 10 years from now this is the new revolutionary system in baseball.

"Someone posted earlier about how a friend thought foul-pole home runs were once-in-a-lifetime events (of course they aren't).  But what really would be a once-in-a-lifetime event?  Americans live on average 78.79 years, and Canadians 82.05 years, so let's call it a round 80 years.

Things we think of as being rare like perfect games and hitting for the cycle really aren't all that rare.  For that matter, even record events like 20 strikeouts aren't all that rare (20 Ks happened twice in one season, even).  And setting the Iron Man record isn't even such an event, because Lou Gehrig set the record 83 years ago and Cal Ripken beat it in 1995, only 63 years later, well within a human lifespan.  So too the single-season home run record was set in 1927, beaten in 1961, again then twice in the '90s-'00s.

I'm sure there have to be some rare things that we'd only expect to see about once in 80 years in MLB.  Any idea of what they could be?

About the only thing I can think of is Johnny Van Der Meer's two consecutive no-hitters in 1938.  Dave Stieb almost did it in 1988, but lost both (one which was perfect to that point, the other a mere no-hitter) with two outs in the ninth inning.

Memorable moments: Oct. 19, 2004
One week after tearing the tendon in his right ankle and getting smoked by the Yankees in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series, Schilling somehow made it back to the mound for Game 6 at Yankee Stadium. It was remarkable that the Red Sox were even still playing, given they had trailed, 3-0, in the series. Schilling underwent an almost barbaric procedure in which his loose tendon was sutured back into place. By the early innings, he had blood pouring through his sock -- yet he was able to fire seven brilliant frames of one-run ball against the Yankees in a 4-2 conquest and force the series to Game 7 -- which the Sox won, of course.

"Alright so I've had some time to mull over the whole affair, and would like to hear some thoughts on how I've viewed the whole situation. This is gonna be a bit of a read, so buckle up if you want. TLDR is at the bottom. Let's get after it boys.

This post is gonna address three major talking points: The Hall of Fame's apparent lack of consistency around steroid use; why Bonds was not elected; why Ortiz was elected. This is from a Bluejays fan. I've despised Ortiz since I was 5 years old. Take from that what you will.

HoF and Bud Selig:

The hall has appeared inconsistent about their view on steroids. It appears as though they wish to treat steroid use similar to gambling. If you do it, you won't be welcomed in Cooperstown. With that being said, you might well wonder wtf is Bud Selig doing in the Hall of fame then? Only 5 commisioners are. Why would a guy who actively downplayed steroid use be allowed in?

The Mitchel Report was done at the request of Bud Selig. He asked congress to independently look into steroid use. I think this is the Hall's justification on overlooking the steroid scandal in light of everything else he did. He brought baseball back in a time when the MLB was facing serious financial issues. He turned it into a money printing machine. 

Should that absolve him of the years of indifference towards the issue of steroid use? The Hall says yes. I think they are justified in their decision. Other commisioners could have easily continued to sweep it under the rug, or conduct their own sham investigations instead of having a third party (congress) do it. Despite the fact he ignored it, he was ultimately the reason steroid use is now treated the way it is. 

Barry Bonds:

Barry Bonds stained what is arguably the most sacred record in baseball. Achieving the home run record was something that brought world wide fame. Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth are very much symbols of America across the globe. Bonds tainted that record.

Not only did he juice, he [denied it repeatedly](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=3113127). He knew what he was doing was wrong. He is the son of a a former big leaguer. 

He has no place in the Hall and no place in baseball. If Pete Rose set the all time hit record and he's not allowed in, Bonds shouldn't be either. I think this actually reflects well on the Hall.

David Ortiz:

He deserves to be in the Hall. Being a Hall of Fame athlete means being more than a great ball player. It means upholding a high level of ethical standards on the diamond, and off of it.

Ortiz was the face of Boston my entire childhood. He was the guy who took the mic after the bombing and said ""this is our f***ing city"". He was a key part of breaking the curse of the Great Bambino.

It also appears that [while he tested positive, he didn't know that he was using a banned substance](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4385699). Not to mention he willingly gave his urine to be tested.

Am I way off on thinking that the Hall did the right thing?

Tldr: Hall did the right thing.",mlb

"The now universal dh is another in a long list of changes that showcases the complete lack of understanding of the game of baseball. I understand that they are doing everything they can too ‚Äúkeep baseball interesting‚Äù but by doing so they have continually altered the game and turned it into a shadow of what it once was and what it was meant to be. And honestly, it makes sense why they wouldn‚Äôt care, even with watch rates decreasing the franchises take home more and more money from advertisement deals. It makes me so angry to see a sport I loved to play with so much potential be ruined by greed and people who have never played the game and are completely out of touch with how the game was meant to be played.

Quick question. So say there is a runner on 1st BASE we‚Äôll call ‚Äúbob‚Äù. Now a second player named ‚ÄòTony‚Äô is batting. Tony hits the ball towards 2nd base. IS Bob forced to run to second so that Tony can get on first? Or can Bob stay on first and let Tony get tagged out. By 2nd throwing to 1st and 1st touching plate.,mlb

"Enlighten me with why the league should allow steroid use. I find no good reason and it will only hurt MLB if everyone starts taking steroids.

Steroids are a drug that could potentially harm people in different ways, and could also harm their families as well. Allowing it will cause players to abuse it and could spread to college and high school baseball too.

Players who don‚Äôt want to use steroids would be in a significant disadvantage for having the right moral. Baseball is more than just hitting HRs, and besides this past decade the league has recorded total HR records multiple times. I love Ichiro and Ohtani who found creative ways to succeed in the sport. Coincidentally they‚Äôre both Japanese players and no Japanese player has been caught for steroids because they know it‚Äôs morally right not to use steroids. 

I want the players to be healthy and don‚Äôt feel forced to take steroids just to stay in the league. I like singles and having runners on base. I don‚Äôt want games to be decided on which team hits more dingers.

And same case for HoF. You can choose to take steroids secretly but once you‚Äôre caught you‚Äôre not in the HoF, simple. Bonds can keep his 7 MVPs but doesn‚Äôt deserve to be HoF and that should be the case for everyone moving on.",mlb

"It's understandable for Vlad to be in first... but it is just crazy that Matt Olson is in 5th.  Having just watched him in three games against the Yankees, this guy is an absolute machine.  

Jose Abreu is ahead of Olson.  By two places.  By an additional 4%.  

I kind of wish fans didn't vote on the All-Star roster at all, because guys who should get in don't, and guys who shouldn't do.  Let's face it, Trout isn't having his best season, and there are quite a few guys who should be ahead of him in voting, yet he's in the lead with 14% because he's Mike Trout.

I'm glad that we don't vote on pitchers, because we'd probably screw that up even worse.",mlb

This is the THIRD time I have tried buying mets tickets from seatgeek, and the only reason I continued after the first time was because I had credits in my account.

"With the news Vlad Jr won‚Äôt be participating in the HRD, what are some thoughts to change the format. My selfish self wanted to watch Vlad crush the ball in coors field.

I mean, Vlad hit 91 HR in the derby last year and lost to Alonso hitting only 57 HR.

Swinging out of your shoes that many times takes a toll on a guy. Alonso had a slump after he won 19 also. 

So if the HRD format was different would they still be able to attract the best hitters in the league. 

My thoughts:

Basically they should do round 1, everyone gets 20 swings and 3 outs. Whichever comes first. Select the top 4 and Then move on to round 2. Every one gets 20 swings and 3 outs. Select the top two for the final round.

And then it should be 1v1 

Dude A goes up gets 10 pitches
Dude B goes up gets 10 pitches
Dude A goes up gets 10 more
Dude B goes up gets 10 more 
Round of 5 pitches each until someone has their ‚Äú3 outs‚Äù

Tie breaks during round 1 and round 2 would be the same 5 pitch alternating rounds",mlb

"Getting rid of sticky stuff will have an unexpected impact on the game; it could screw with the setup man/closer strategy. Teams could need more pitchers on their roster, all because starting pitchers will more often, need to be yanked earlier.

You'd have the same pitcher-innings impact on your roster if you moved the rubber back a foot. 

Batting coaches may need to drop the home run or bust strategy. On the brighter side, with fewer batters constantly swinging for the fences, the infield shift may fall out of favor.

Knocking the wind out of your opponent's bullpen early in your series loses some of its impact when it simply becomes more common.

It's not that teams are looking for complete games, but the formula of your starter getting you 6 or 7 innings to get you to your setup man and then your closer will be more elusive.

Are you going to need more utility players to take up that slack in the roster, fewer development roster slots, Rule 5 draft acquisitions? This could complicate the CBA negotiations coming up this year.",mlb

I love traditional baseball as I grew up in the '60's watching and listening to it. I don't like many of the modern changes to the game but since that box for the strike zone is always visible on tv showing the balls and strikes it's time to use it. It would be hard to remove it now that people are used to it anyway. They say they are working the bugs out of the system so why not give the umps AR glasses and let them see the box and show them how the ball intersects the box and let them decide if they think it's valid. The days of watching umps control the game with calls that at times can be far outside the strike zone (or worse strikes called balls have to be over.,mlb

"Might get hate here since it is the MLB section..might not but I don‚Äôt know..

I use to love the MLB. It was by far my favorite league out of the sports even the NFL. I grew up as big as a die hard Yankees fan as anyone else. I really only watched the Yankees but I was still up to speed on which teams were the best, who the top players were at each position, and just overall dialed in. That was probably 5+ years ago at least. 

Now? I rarely watch even the Yankees. Something just feels off with the MLB over the past years. I saw a post here awhile back that the MLB is slowly turning into how wrestling (WWE) did. Everyone still remembers the golden era of wrestlers but barely the new ones. I feel the same with baseball. I use to be able to sound of the top 5 players at each position without hesitation and that was without even watching much of any team other than the Yankees. Now, I have no idea. I can name you the 2002 Angels lineup still to this day. Rivalries? What rivalries today other than everyone hating the Astros? Everyone can admit (even Yankees fans) that the early to mid 2000s Red Sox team were some of the most exciting baseball teams ever. There was nothing better than a beautiful weekend, BBQing, and having the FOX Yanks/Sox at Fenway game on in the background that is only in the 5th inning after 4hrs and the score is 11-9 with hated stars on each side of the likes of Arod, Jeter, Pedro, Ortiz, Manny, Papelbon, etc. There isn‚Äôt a single a player on the Sox today I would stand up at Yankee Stadium and boo aside from the manager Alex Cora.

Then there is the Hr Derby and ASG. I use get so giddy with early July coming and for this to watch. 

Sorry for the long post and would love to hear others thoughts. I know the ratings have been terrible as well. This isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúHate MLB‚Äù thread.

"Framework to overhaul baseball and get a new collective marketing agreement:

My goals: Eliminate tanking, make all owners want to field competitive teams, allow players and owners to equally share in revenue, improve the pace/entertainment of games.

Salaries/Revenue:

\-Owner would need to full open their books to an impartial third party that players agree upon.

\-Owners and players would settle on a % of overall revenues that they would receive - let's say 50%.  This 50% would be divided by the number of teams and be not only a salary cap, but a floor as well (see the next items).  No team could spend more than this amount and would need to take this into account when it comes to in-season trades.

\-Each player would qualify for ML pay credits based on their salary divided by the number of games they are on the active MLB roster for whatever team(s) they are playing throughout the year.

\-At the end of the year, each team's portion of player salaries that was not spent would be divided out and given (based on a ratio of the pay credits formula above) to all players that were on their MLB roster for at least one game to bring that team's salary spend up to the agreed %.

\-Revenue sharing between teams would need to be more like the NFL with all gate/concessions/tv revenue split something like 60/40 by the home/away teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Rules Changes:

\-Add the DH in the National league

\-Institute a pitch clock as well as forcing the batter to stay in the batter's box.  Perhaps give each pitcher and hitter a number of times they can receive exceed this per game without penalty, much like the current limitation on mound visits (SP - 3 times, RP - 1 time, hitter - 1 time).

\-Eliminate the shift and if possible, move back the fences at all parks 10-20 feet to make put more balls in play (less strikeouts/homeruns).

\-Allow unlimited relief pitcher changes (without making them pitch to three batters), but have pitchers to be already in the team dugout and ready to come in instead of having to run in from the dugout.  They will have 30 seconds once they reach the mound to take practice pitches and there will be a picture-in-picture tv commercial like what is done in soccer games instead of cutting away completely.

\-Have a runner starting on second base in extra innings once the game makes it past the 10th inning (only during regular season).

&amp;#x200B;

Re-alignment/interleague play:

\-Add two further teams to get to 32 teams overall, with 4 8-team divisions.

\-Have the top in each 8 team division make the playoffs along with a best of three play-in series from the next two in each division.

\-As there will be salary parity, the un-balanced schedule can remain within each 8-team division, though there should always be at least one home and away series between each team in each league once a year.

\-Remove all interleague play or at most keep a single ""rivalry"" once a year for a home and away series.

&amp;#x200B;

Further radical ideas:

\-Have a ""draft pick"" tournament of all teams that did not make the playoffs to determine the draft order of the first round of the next draft.  Players on teams that did make the playoffs will all be given large enough bonuses to remove any impetus for managers/team wanting them to tank.

\-Change the draft to be more like the NHL draft where high school players are handled.  The rights of such players that are drafted can be held by the team that drafted them until their next draftable time (for high school players, the next period would be after their sophomore year of college like it is now) for a cost of X dollars.  This would bring back a manner of the old draft and follow option that was around a while back and allow teams to take a hedged flyer on a high end high school player and retain their rights through the next draft.  If that player did not sign, they would then go back into the following season's draft (after their Junior season) without restrictions.  Each draft position will have a specific value that is set.  This will eliminate negotiation/holdouts/etc.  Institute an international player draft.

\-Allow managers to give up a full inning of batting for an extra out in a current inning (For example the bases are loaded in the 6th, your team is down 2 runs and a hitter just struck out for the 3rd out.  Instead of losing what might be your best opportunity to tie the game, you bring up another batter, but lose your 9th inning to bat).  This will bring in some strategy to the game with the benefit of possibly shortening games by 1-2 innings, but not doing so arbitrability just to shorten them.",mlb

"The 2015 Playoffs were pretty great, got to see the Royals ride a great core to another AL championship and actually finish off it and win a WS over the Mets. However, possibly the biggest story of the playoffs was Daniel Murphy. Murphy had always been a solid hitter with mediocre defense which made him a solid MLB starter at 2nd for the first half of his career, in 2015 he posted a .281/.322/.770 slash line with 14 HRs and 73 RBIs for a total 1.9 (Baseball reference numbers) oWAR and 1.2 WAR total. However in the 2015 postseason Daniel Murphy went crazy, in 14 games hitting .328/.391/1.115 with 7 HRs and basically dragged the Mets past the Cubs and the Dodgers. His postseason led to the start of the Statcast or Launch angle era where players began selling out to loft the ball leading to the 3 true outcome baseball we now days watch. To me I hate this type of baseball, being a mid-90s kid I personally think the best baseball I have watched was from 2007 to 2015. This was more traditional offensive baseball so I want to look at two players who played a premium defensive position one from Pre- Statcast era and one that occurred during the Statcast Era. When out of primary position they played at positions that their oWAR would be affected due to the expected offensive production by an average player.

Player A- Pre-Statcast- 136 games played at primary position, 20 played out of position for 156 games total- Slash - .301/.373/.837 with 13 homers, 69 RBIs, 53 doubles, and 73 runs. 

Player B- Post-Statcast-  120 games started at primary position with 124 games played total at position, 40 games started out of position playing in 161 games total. Slashed- .273/.316/.859 with 48 homeruns, 121 RBIs, 24 doubles, 88 runs.

Player A produced oWAR of 5.6, while Player B produced an oWAR of 4.6.

Player A was Johnathan Lucroy's fantastic 2014 season when he was chasing the doubles record and playing great defense behind the plate. 

Player B was Salvador Perez's 2021 year, which I heard people hail as one the best offensive catcher season of all-time. It wasn't close to Lucroy's 2014, granted Perez played more games at DH would have negatively effected his oWAR value, Lucroy's out of position games was at 1st which would have effected his oWAR value as well. 

What does this mean? Well the current offensive philosophy dictates that a low OBP player that mashes homeruns is a measurably worse player then a guy lighter hitter or drills XBH. Even if in this case the player had 35 more homeruns then player who gets on base, gets XBH without trading avg for power. Also a great example for people to look at how flawed the current hitting philosophy is in the MLB. Hope yall enjoy.",mlb

"I just started working for an MLB team and the pay disparity between the players and employees is the widest I‚Äôve ever seen in any industry and it makes me sick. 

The players are unionized, and I know if I mention the idea of a union for us on the bottom I will be fired. They push cost cutting to no avail, we are limited on hours so we wont trigger the right to health insurance or other benefits. It‚Äôs so hard for me to get behind nickeling and dimeing over petty details when the highest paid (and greatly underachieving) pitcher is making three of our yearly salaries per day regardless of whether he pitches of not. 

The situation that exists behind the shiny facade of Major League Baseball‚Äôs legal monopoly is ugly for the people supporting the players on the field. I‚Äôm generally a conservative red blooded American who believes in free markets, but this is really messing with my motivation to work within the context of my fiduciary responsibility for the team.

I did a bunch of research on the situation and yes I‚Äôve seen the photos. But it‚Äôs the fact that the LA district attorney denied this woman‚Äôs request to a restraining order, that makes me feel that maybe there‚Äôs more moving parts to it.

While I don‚Äôt support or condone Bauer‚Äôs actions as a human being. And yes he wasn‚Äôt found *not* guilty, the charges were just dropped.

I know the question has already been asked but I think that the teams changed a lot within the last years so the recommendations that has been made 2 to 3 years ago may not be relevant today.

I live in France so I sadly can not pick the team of my region, so I was wondering if you can help me.

I'm a big soccer fan (like almost everyone in Europe) but I support a French club which is very popular in France but not outside, but to summarize, what I like about this club is the fervor of the fans, you never get bored with them and the feeling of a team giving everything they have every game even when they are not the favorites with a pleasant way of playing to watch, and I was wondering if there is an equivalent in the MLB, not especially the best team, but the kind of team that makes you really invest yourself in it and that try to display a non-boring play most of the time.

"I grew up loving baseball, and though I was a kid, I still remember going to games at Three Rivers and seeing stars like Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds, Andy VanSlyke, Sid Bream, etc. We've had one good run since those almost glory days. Oddly enough, with the consistently bad performance and terrible ability/lack of desire to onboard and keep good players, why the sam hell do any of you still support this club? I mean, it's fine to root for an underdog, and I get that, and I'm not pissed at the players. I'm disgusted by the management and ownership. Each year we field a team that is hardly better/likely worse than most minor league teams. I've since protested by not giving them any money. Sure, if a pal of mine spends the $5 for seats I'll go with them to enjoy the beautiful field and view of the city, but I'll be damned if I throw any money at this club until they right this ship.

I don't know that much about baseball, but I know there's revenue sharing and other money rolling in that can be spent on at least a few good core players in a league with NO SALARY CAP. 

Hell, just go to Seven Springs to ski. I like the place and it's close for me, but you can tell how cheap the owner is (same owner as the Pirates) because that place is like the fucking Hot Tub Time Machine. All the storage lockers share the same color patterns as the ugly uniform the Astros wore for too long.

Stop giving your money to this club. If you still insist on doing so, please tell me why. This is nuts.

I realize there are a million other things in the world to worry about, but hey, our taxes go to that stadium already, and the Pirates rarely fill the seats unless a really good team comes to town, and that's inexcusable. We should be filling seats to see our own big talent.",mlb

" 

There was this MLB pitcher named Rick Honeycutt who in 1980 thought he could get away with cheating by taping a thumbtack on his finger to try to scuff the ball and hopefully not get caught. The method didn't work the way he intended as the Umpires did notice marks on the ball and Honeycutt (with the ironic last name) ended up cutting his forehead when he accidentally rubbed it with the hand that had the thumbtack resulting in bleeding. He was ejected and suspended for ten games. 

It's very hard to try to scuff the ball and not get noticed because the Umpires check every single ball throughout the game and if they suspect something, they will immediately approach the pitcher to examine any illegal substance on the pitcher's body. It also doesn't help that the pitcher is constantly being watched on camera and it wouldn't take long for the opponent's manager to notice something on the footage and all he has to do is tell the umpires to examine the pitcher if he suspects something against the rules is happening. 

I got to give credit to Honeycutt for trying something different, but it clearly didn't work the way he intended. I however can't find any video footage of this incident and with it taking place in 1980, you'd think footage would exist.",mlb

"I think we all agree that having either the Dodgers or Giants forced into a 1 game playoff after dominating the NL all year is nonsense.  In all seriousness I'm guessing someone else has thought of this already but I did just come up with this on my own:

- 6-team playoff per league.

- 3 spots are given to the division winners, the next 3 are given to the 3 best records amongst non division winners.

- Seeding is determined by *record*, not division winners, however.  (Which means if the season ended today, the Giants would be the #1 seed and Dodgers would be #2)

- #1 and #2 seeds get a bye the wildcard round.

- #3 vs #6 and #4 vs #5 in a 3-game, or perhaps even 5-game series.

I think this accomplishes two very important things for MLB.  First, it keeps a team who has dominated the league for an entire season from getting knocked out by an inferior team in one game.  I mean come on now, baseball is numbers game that evens itself out over the course of a season, teams play in *series'* all year long... but now after 162 games it all comes down to ONE?

Secondly, it also sets up a good chance of your two best teams (#1 and #2) having a showdown in the LCS's, which is how it should be.


Bottom line is that no team should have a 1 game playoff for their entire season after grinding for 162 games, but if teams DO have to do that, it certainly shouldn't be the 2nd best team in the league.",mlb

I've even heard it insinuated and implied that sometimes being overly celebratory can even get hitters beaned in later at-bats. 

On the other hand - it seems like a pretty common place and accepted for pitchers to scream, flex, and posture in celebration after getting a hard strike out; especially to end the inning. Is that not equally ""disrespectful""?

"Does MLB, the PA and Rob Manfred truly understand the impact of most not having access to RSN is killing a game that has been loosing viewers for years. This along with the stupid blackout rule is keeping many mainstream viewers without access to their favorite teams. Not to mention the vast influx of great young talent that many in this generation will grow up watching for years to come.

One would think after last years covid issues, no fans in the seats, blackout restrictions would have been lifted but no dice and now we don‚Äôt even have the RSN to catch the games that are being televised last year. 

No wonder there is a major decline in overall viewership and participation at the lower levels.

"Hi folks, I am sure I am not the first to think about that, so there might a quick answer out. This is just theoretical thinking about the limits of demotion and promotion of players to the MLB roster. Most teams went with eleven or twelve pitchers on their 25-man roster, and 13 position players. Today it is usually 14 pitchers and 12 fielders, and you see people playing out of position more often than before. Thus my question: is it possible to theoretically create an additional spot for a position player by tactically demoting and promoting pitchers ? E.g. Only four starting pitchers are on the roster. #1 is immediately demoted after his start, while #5 is promoted, and so on ? That would result in one more spot for another player. What are the theoretical limitations for such a scheme ? I suppose number of times someone can be promoted/demoted, minimum duration...May I ask to weigh in ? Thanks.",mlb

Once the signal from the manager has been given, the pitcher has \_\_\_\_\_ amount of time to be ready to deliver the pitch to the batter, providing he is ready?

MLB fans: Red Sox did not use real time technology. Other teams weren‚Äôt caught. Astros materially changed the outcomes of games. 

My question: someone explain to me how Barry Bonds, Manny Ramirez, Gary Shieffield, etc. is taking PED‚Äôs is different? They took PED‚Äôs that enhanced their performance and materially altered the game.

     I love the Upton brothers, B.J. ‚ÄúBoss man Jr.‚Äù (Melvin) and Justin. I know neither of these two are all-time greats, but they are both very special baseball players, and my favorite baseball brothers. 
     B.J. was drafted 2nd overall in 2002, behind Bryan Bullington and before Chris Gruler. He would have the best career of any top 5 pick that year (Grienke was drafted 6th). He debuted two years after being drafted, at the age of 19. As the (Devil) Rays fielded a roster with Scott Kazmir, Upton, Carl Crawford, and Rocco Baldelki, it was easy to be excited for that teams future. B.J. was basically the Byron Buxton of the mid-late 2000‚Äôs - all the tools, but inconsistent. He had four 20-20 seasons, stole 40 bases three seasons in a row, and stole 30 five seasons in a row. His time in Atlanta was a disaster, but his final season showed us a glimpse of the younger B.J. when he hit 20 home runs and stole 27 bags, albeit with a .693 OPS. I remember him fondly as a truly exciting player who somehow lost plate discipline as he aged, however disappointing others may view him. 
     Justin Upton was drafted first overall in 2005, an historically loaded top 10. Alex Gordon went 2nd, Ryan Zimmerman 4th, Braun 5th, Tulo 7th; loaded. He would debut two years after being drafted, at 19, in 2007. Although reports of Justin having some of the ‚Äúbest tools of any prospect ever‚Äù were plentiful, he bulked up as he aged and never quite showed that elite (6.23 second 60) speed in the majors. Though, he has stolen 15 or more bases 5 times. He has also showed very consistent power accumulating 8 seasons of 25 or more home runs. Like B.J., Justin‚Äôs career has largely been seen as a ‚Äúwhat-if,‚Äù though still more than respectable. 
     My point is this, the Upton‚Äôs are special. Two brothers drafted in the top 2 overall, both debuted at 19, both played 10+ years, and yet neither truly lived up to their potential. They are my favorite baseball brothers, and a great reminder that potential doesn‚Äôt guarantee a thing. 

Please feel free to share stories, expand the conversation, tell me your favorite baseball brothers or family, or even tell me how dumb I am and that you couldn‚Äôt disagree more. But mostly, thanks for reading!",mlb

We had discussed the whole cheating situation multiple times and talked about how there will be a ton of booing at the game. No problem there. They deserve it. However, I thought the Seattle fans would be a little more chill than LA or Oakland fans.

I have never experienced so much negativity. The crowd that surrounded us harassed us the whole game screaming f\* you every other minute. When my kid showed some excitement when the Astros scored, the fans behind us mocked him. I don't know what kind of person it takes to jump in nine-year old's face and yell f\*ing cheater. Y'all are special. Even when the Mariners scored, they screamed a profusion of profanity. There was no celebrating, just negativity. Is this the state of baseball in the pandemic? 

Please don't take your kids to these games. There is nothing kid friendly no matter if you are a Mariners or an Astros' fan. The father behind me screamed the same stuff in front of his kids.

However, I tried to watch the game tonight in Seattle, only to find out that this game is blacked out too. I clicked on something that says I can pay extra to watch.

"It feels like Dodger Stadium specifically is the Rockies‚Äô kryptonite. I think I saw a stat last night that said that the Rockies lost 20 of their last 23 games at Dodger Stadium. You could say ‚Äúwell the Rockies just suck and the Dodgers are too good‚Äù but I realized that it doesn‚Äôt matter how good or bad the Dodgers or Rockies are, the Rockies seem to always get owned at Dodger Stadium no matter the circumstances. 

I am sure we all saw this sweep coming a mile away. Heck, even I knew the Rockies were not winning Game 163 in 2018 simply because it was at Dodger Stadium. The Rockies all time record of 40 games below .500 at Dodger Stadium really speaks for itself too. However when they play at Coors Field, it feels like they are evenly matched most of the time. 

So with that said, I‚Äôve always wondered: why do the Rockies seem to always flop at Dodger Stadium? What is it about that atmosphere that ruins them?",mlb

"I've been following mlb since the early 90's, and used to play for 14 years. One of the first things as a kid we learned was to always have respect for the uniform. Colours had to be the club colours, even the under shirt.  Nowadays it bothers me to see these young guys in the MLB to have like 2-3 chains around their necks. And the sleeves, they have nothing to do with club colours in many cases. I think it even was forbidden. I mean, in my days if you were noticed, it was because you played the game hard and respectfully. Not for looking like a clown with 2 different sleeves and stutter steps around the bases. Also,  why the batflips? If you strike out 4 times and then hit a homerun, you really shouldn't do that in my opinion, you should be pissed off because you struck out 4 times. Maybe I'm just getting old, but over the last few years for me, baseball is looking more &amp; more like a circus. Which hurts, because I truly love this game.",mlb

"With five days remaining in¬†Trevor Bauer's current administrative leave, rendered after he was accused of sexual assault, Major League Baseball investigators are pursuing a range of inquiries, according to sources.

Investigators intend to speak with the woman who obtained a restraining order against Bauer last week. To date, MLB investigators have communicated with her lawyer, but hope to speak to her directly, sources said.

In a domestic violence restraining order filed against Bauer last Monday, the woman said Bauer strangled her to the point of unconsciousness during sex on multiple occasions, repeatedly punched her in the face during sex and left her with injuries that required hospitalization. Bauer has denied the accusations.

Investigators are delving into Bauer's history and the question of whether there have been other incidents, sources said, a line of inquiry that MLB has followed in cases subject to the sport's domestic violence policy. At some point, MLB officials would like to speak to Bauer directly, but it is unclear if that will happen any time soon.

The¬†Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher is under criminal investigation by the Pasadena Police Department, and any conversation he has with MLB would be subject to subpoena. The case is expected to be sent to the Pasadena district attorney's office.
Theoretically, Bauer's administrative leave ends on Friday. However, there have been repeated instances in the past that MLB players under criminal investigation have shifted to indefinite leave, to allow time for resolution of the legal matters and for baseball to advance its own inquiries.",mlb

"Please hear this out from a long time baseball fan.

After Judge's injury last year, Vladdy is reluctant to participate in the Derby this year. No chance their teams want them getting injured, however;  


# What if the HR Derby was...

* 10 Players Derby for 3 Years. 1 Hitter from each team. 30 Teams  


**Every Year**

**2nd Place** = *1 Win, -1 Loss*

**1st Place** = *2 Win, -2 Loss*

&amp;#x200B;

* **TOP 2** from each year play in an 8 man every 4 years, like an Olympic style event.

**1st in Tournament**: *3 Wins, -3 Loss*

**2nd in Tournament**: *2 Wins, -2 Loss*

&amp;#x200B;

Huge incentive for teams to send their stars. Vladdy is going to sit out the Derby and play against Baltimore after. This would make it the other way around. Would be awesome to see Mancini go off and give his team **2 Wins** for participating hard when they're in last place. 

Understandable that in 4 years players can change/get traded, so the team where they won gets the spot in that top 2. Where it is right now teams that are in the playoff race won't send guys.

  
Middle of July with a packed house and wins on the line. Spice it up and these guys will show up and try hard.",mlb

"As of right now only the red sox and giants have reached 50 wins within their first 81 games. The dodgers have a chance at their 50th win in their 81st game tonight (july 1st) against the nationals. Assuming they do that would be 3 teams who are barely on pace for 100 wins. 

This year it doesnt feel like any team is dominating in a way to be a clear 100 game winner. My prediction is that this will be the first full 162 game season since 2014 with no 100 game winner. I may be wrong, the giants are the best bet right now, they have 50 wins in 79 games. And there are other teams who were barely short of 50 wins in the first 81 games. I just dont see any team who just missed the mark getting 50+ wins for the rest of the year. And i think teams like the red sox giants and dodgers will just miss the mark as the year ends. Especially as they rest players once divisions are clinched.

Every (non-full-blown-pandemic) year, my wife and I like to travel to a new stadium, and when possible I try to tie it with a team or stadium celebrating with a stamped ball.

"With the MLB situation as it is right now I figured we may have to manufacture some of our own fun in order to enjoy baseball this spring. To that end, I‚Äôve got three words for you: Joe Buck Bot!

That‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm talking about an AI-powered baseball commentary generator that could provide commentary of any game in the soothing voice and impeccable style of one of the greatest baseball commentators of our time, Joe Buck. 

I see this project having three distinct aims:

1) Voice Synthesizer: Curate a collection of games commentated by Buck. Use these to mine a corpus of speech sounds necessary to generate any sentence in the English language. They did something similar for Roger Ebert. 

2) Play-by-play: Train an algorithm to map pitch-by-pitch data and/or scoresheets to archived video to create natural descriptive commentary that syncs with the action as presented on screen. 

3) Statistical Analysis: Train an algorithm to identify patterns in the game being watched and use those to automate the analysis of relevant historical baseball stats to provide context, highlight potential records in the making, and provide some of the signature zingers and anecdotes Joe is known for.

A little about me: 
I‚Äôm a data analyst working for a major government agency. I excel at pivot tables and I‚Äôm pretty good with cleaning CSVs in rStudio, so I‚Äôm pretty much there technically but I could use a few more hands on deck to help out with most of aims 1, 2, and 3 above.

"1966 NL MVP

The 1966 was possibly Sandy Koufax‚Äôs best season, but also his last. Roberto Clemente won his only MVP, as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron finished behind him. It was also the only time in MLB history two brothers both finished top ten in MVP voting. 

The voting went 1) Clemente 2) Koufax 3) Mays 4) Allen 5) Felipe Alou 6) Merichal 7) Regan 8) Aaron 9) Matty Alou 10) Rose.

Roberto Clemente .317/.360/.536 29 HR, 119 RBI, 105 R, 71 XBH

* For the first time in Clemente‚Äôs career he broke 100 RBIs in a season, and with the most notable reason being his situational hitting. Clemente led the league with a .400 AVG, .703 SLG and 1.164 OPS (in 204 PA) with RISP. He even kept his AVG at .400 and improved his OPS to 1.195 with two-out and RISP in 65 ABs. Much of Clemente‚Äôs value was in the field, as he led NL outfielders by throwing out 17 runners. Clemente finished second in the NL in total bases, extra-base hits and RBIs. The Pirates finished the year in third place, but won 92 games. Clemente‚Äôs 29 home runs would be the most he ever hit in a season.¬†

Sandy Koufax 1.73 ERA, 27-9, 323.0 IP, 317 K

* After winning the 1963 NL MVP and finishing runner-up in 1965, Koufax again finished runner-up in 1966 despite having the most first place votes. Koufax's 317 strikeouts were the fifth most in history, and he became the first pitcher in history to reach 300 strikeouts three different times. Koufax‚Äôs 1.73 ERA was the sixth lowest in the Live Ball Era (1920-present). The Dodgers pitching staff gave up only 490 runs in 1966, which was the lowest since World War II and the fifth least in the Live Ball Era (seventh least today). The 95 wins Dodgers clinched the NL by only two games over their rival San Francisco Giants, and without Koufax it's hard to see them doing so as Los Angeles went 29-12 when he pitched and 66-55 in all other games. Koufax led the league in ERA, IP, K, and Wins. Koufax would retire after the season due to an elbow injury, and five years later at age 36 would become the youngest Hall of Famer ever.¬†

Willie Mays .288/.368/.556 37 HR, 103 RBI, 99 R

* Mays won the 1954 and 1965 NL MVP -- making the largest gap in MLB history between winning the award again. Although just about every NL MVP in the gap years are scrutinized today for Mays not winning the award. The Giants finished two games behind the Dodgers for the NL pennant, which was the exact same scenario the previous season. In 1966 Mays finished third in home runs, fourth in RBIs, fifth in total bases in and sixth in OPS. Mays may not have been quite the player he once was, but he was still among the NL leaders in every statistic. Mays had a .351 AVG with RISP and that rose to .381 with two-out. A highlight included Mays hitting his 512th home run May 4th, setting the all-time National League record, and by the season‚Äôs end had the second most in all of baseball history.¬†

Dick Allen .317/.396/.632 40 HR, 110 RBI, 112 R, 331 TB, 75 XBH

* Allen had a huge offensive season in 1966, leading the league in OPS, slugging and extra-base hits. Allen also finished third in RBIs and OBP while fourth in AVG. He also contributed by hitting .351 with a 1.140 OPS with RISP and those rose to .368 and 1.194 with two-out and RISP. Allen‚Äôs season could have been even more productive, but in late April he dislocated his right shoulder and missed three weeks. After returning, Allen moved to left field to hide his throwing arm which would be less effective the rest of his career. He moved back to third base in July, but spent the 1966 season as a defensive liability.

Hank Aaron .279/.356/.539 44 HR, 127 RBI, 117 R, 325 TB

* Aaron led the league in both home runs and RBIs and finished second in runs scored. As the Braves relocated and played their first season in Atlanta many criticized their new ballpark Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for being so hitter friendly due to the dimensions and the heat in Atlanta. This resulted in the ballpark quickly getting the nickname ‚ÄòThe Launching Pad.‚Äô The Braves scored a league leading 782 runs and 207 home runs -- which were the eighth most in baseball history. While Aaron‚Äôs still drove in runs and homered at a league best, his other numbers were not up to his usual high standard. Aaron‚Äôs OPS was its lowest since his rookie season, and he set a career low in batting average.¬†

Felipe Alou .327/.361/.533 31 HR, 74 RBI, 122 R, 218 H, 69 XBH, 355 TB

* Alou had the best season of his 17 year career in 1966, leading the NL in runs, hits and total bases. Alou along with Hank Aaron was part of a Braves team that moved to Atlanta and was criticized for their offensive output being enhanced because of their hitter's park. Yet even on a team with future cooperstown inductees Aaron and Eddie Matthews, Alou was their leading MVP finisher. Although Alou finished second in the batting title, his brother Matty won it by hitting .342 in Pittsburg. Matty also finished ninth in MVP voting. This is the only time in MLB history where two siblings finished first and second in hitting or both top ten in MVP voting.¬†

"Hi! New fan of Baseball from India! I'm a huge NBA/Lakers/Kobe fan since I was a kid, later got into the NFL.

Give me your opinion On Bryce Harper. Do you love him. Do you think He's a clown. Do You think he's underated. Do you think He's overrated.,mlb
,mlb
i am.,mlb
"Any current or historical examples you can think of? I think the most obvious example today is Bryce Harper; with all the hoopla surrounding him (generational play, most talented ever, etc.), some of which turned out to be slightly overblown, it is easy to forget that the man is on a HOF trajectory: 38.3 fWAR at 28y7m, already had a signature season (2015), and counting stats + accolades (1 MVP, ROTY winner, 6x all-star.) 


My favourite historical example is Joe D. He was erroneously called the ‚Äògreatest living ball-player‚Äô and lionized by the New York media. Had he played elsewhere he would not have been as much of a cultural icon. However, he also happened to play in a park that handicapped him more than any great righty power hitter, ever. 

His career splits at the ol‚Äô Yankee Stadium: .315/.391/.546

On the road: .333/.405/.610

Gosh, was that park ever death for right-handed hitters in those days. Joe D, for what it‚Äôs worth, out-averaged Ted Williams on the road and slugged only .005 worse. Granted, the OBP was substantially in Williams favour, but still! Some people consider Williams the greatest hitter ever and JD hit with as much power as him on the road. I can‚Äôt think of an all-time great more penalized by their home park. I wonder about the approximate effect it had on his career WAR. If he played in practically any other park and didn‚Äôt lose 3 seasons to WW2 I think it‚Äôs plausible he‚Äôd have amassed 110-120 career WAR. For that reason I think he‚Äôs a tad underrated by the analytics community, which tends to rank him in the low 20s nowadays. 

Now, one might say, ‚Äòpark factors! They adjust for this stuff‚Äô ‚Äî well, no, not quite. OYS was a graveyard for righty power hitters, but on aggregate it was not a pitchers park. The short right field porch benefitted lefties substantially. It does not adjust for handedness. 

Now, while I‚Äôm a SABRhead I deviate a little from some orthodoxies when ranking players by placing more importance on skill and adjusting for vagaries and happenstance than some. Yes, career value is the most important thing to consider, sure. But, I look at someone like DiMaggio and can‚Äôt help but think his skill level exceeded his statistics or accumulated career value (which is legendarily great even with 3 lost prime seasons, 83.6 fWAR) and not for nebulous reasons like ‚Äòhe just didn‚Äôt live up to his potential‚Äô, ‚Äòhis head wasn‚Äôt screwed on right‚Äô, but for some freak anomaly that is both 

a) quantifiable 
b) not adjusted for like overall park factor is 

Does DiMaggio magically become a better baseball player if he hits at, say? Fenway his entire career, where he hit .334/.415/.605 (80 points better than his OPS at home against the Sox)? No! He also doesn‚Äôt win all those WS‚Äô. Yet, he becomes orders of magnitude more valuable. And that applies to him playing in every other American League park. 

While you can say ‚Äòb-but he should have adjusted!‚Äô ‚Äî that‚Äôs technically true but pushing the limits of what is reasonable to expect from a right-handed power hitter playing in a home park historically unsuited to his talents. Rings similar to ‚Äòpull yourself up by the bootstraps‚Äô ‚Äî good advice, but hollow. No righty power hitter did. Joe Gordon was LESS of a power/pull hitter than Joe yet he ‚Äòadjusted‚Äô as poorly, if not worse. 

The inverse of this is Jimmie Foxx. He is unanimously remembered as the better hitter, and maybe he was (it could be that he adjusted his swing to his park to such a degree that it radically altered his road stays) but look at his home/road splits: 

Home: .345/.454/.663
Road: .307/.405/.560

Joe has 50 road OPS points on him. They are both right-handed pull hitters, but one played in offensively robust parks for righties, the other did not. Joe is a better hitter and a top 10-15 all-time player, not top 20-25 or any of that jazz. I know gifting unearned career value is like printing money, but I can‚Äôt ignore my eyes here and pretend Joe D. is in the Jimmie Foxx tier all-time.  


Just my (radically unorthodox) take.

Question for all the New Yorkers. Which New York Baseball team has a bigger/Loyal home fan base in NYC Mets or Yankees?,mlb

"**NOTE:** This is not how I personally want the MLB to look, nor am I guaranteeing that this will happen. This is just a hypothetical on the direction I believe the MLB is headed.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2022, after the new CBA negotiations the DH will become universal and there will be an electronic strike zone.

In 2022, Cleveland Indians name would be changed to the Cleveland Spiders.

In 2025, after the lease on the Coliseum expires after the 2024 season, the Oakland Athletics would relocate to Las Vegas but would keep the same name.

In 2028, after the lease on Tropicana Field expires after the 2027 season, the Tampa Bay Rays would relocate to Montreal and be renamed the Expos.

In 2028, the two expansion teams would be placed in Portland (Beavers) and Nashville (Stars).

In 2028 The 2 leagues would each be realigned into 4 4-team divisions with 1 expansion team in each league.

In 2028, the new Expos would then be swapped to the National League.

In 2028, Colorado Rockies would be swapped to the American League to even things out.

The league will likely want to keep important rivalries such as Yankees-Red Sox, Cubs-Cardinals and Dodgers-Giants. However they probably wont want same city teams such as Yankees-Mets, Cubs-Sox and Dodgers-Angels in the same division.

&amp;#x200B;

The American League:

|AL East|AL North|AL South|AL West|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baltimore Orioles|Chicago White Sox|Colorado Rockies|Las Vegas Athletics|
|Boston Red Sox|Cleveland Spiders|Houston Astros|Los Angeles Angels|
|New York Yankees|Detroit Tigers|Kansas City Royals|Portland Beavers|
|Toronto Blue Jays|Minnesota Twins|Texas Rangers|Seattle Mariners|

&amp;#x200B;

The National League:

|NL East|NL North|NL South|NL West|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Montreal Expos|Chicago Cubs|Atlanta Braves|Arizona D' backs|
|New York Mets|Milwaukee Brewers|Cincinnati Reds|Los Angeles Dodgers|
|Philadelphia Phillies|Pittsburgh Pirates|Miami Marlins|San Diego Padres|
|Washington Nationals|St. Louis Cardinals|Nashville Stars|San Francisco Giants|

&amp;#x200B;

The Regular Season Schedule:

The MLB has long talked about reducing the number of games in the regular season. I feel as though the number they will settle on is 156 games after they expand the league. With the DH becoming universal, the MLB would probably ensure that each team play each team at least once. Here is how I see the schedule breaking down:

12 games each vs. all 3 division opponents = 36 games 

6 games each vs. all 12 non-division opponents = 72 games

3 games each vs. all 16 interleague opponents = 48 games

= 156 game regular season  
Each team would be guaranteed at least 1 off day each week. There would be all 3-game series.

&amp;#x200B;

The Postseason:

The MLB has discussed a 14-team postseason seriously in recent years. With expansion happening, this will probably cement it. Here is how it will likely breakdown:

The 4 division winners would be seeded 1-4 by record within their respective league. The 3 wild card teams would be seeded 5-7 by record within their respective league.

The would be a best of 3 wild card series with all games hosted by the higher seeds (division winners).

The #2 seed vs. #7 seed, the #3 seed vs. #6 seed, the #4 seed vs. #5 seed.   
The #1 seed would get an automatic bye from the wild-card round.

After that, the remainder of the postseason would proceed as normal.",mlb

"With the VC results being announced in a couple of weeks, I figured it was time we could make predictions on who the Cooperstown class of 2022 will be, so here's mine. I'll start with each committee and then go through each person on the BBWAA ballot.

EARLY BASEBALL ERA COMMITTEE: There's a lot of historic players worthy of consideration (including a giant host of Negro League players), and with this being the committee's first ever meeting it could go any which way. We've got the first African-American minor league player, the Josh Gibson of pitchers, and #4 on the longest hitting streak ranking all in the running. With this first time, though, I have a gut feeling they're going to pick someone who was actually alive at the same time as them, so my money's on either Allie Reynolds or Buck O'Neil getting voted in. 

GOLDEN DAYS ERA COMMITTEE: For this one, I'm mainly going off of previously results. My heart says Roger Maris deserves to be in, and there seems to be a pretty strong following for Minnie Minoso and Dick Allen online. But with how well he did the last time (being a single vote shy of enshrinement), I'm predicting Tony Oliva will be the one to get in, with Jim Kaat a close second (it also helps that they're, you know, alive)

CURT SCHILLING: I'm going to say this right now: Schilling deserves to be in. If Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander are basically locks at this point, Schilling should be that and then some. And to be clear, I HATE his politics. But that shouldn't be the reason why someone doesn't get elected into the Hall. The only real barrier should be if you're a genuine criminal (more on that later). As for whether or not he'll get in, that will depend on how the BBWAA reacts to him famously ""cancelling"" them and asking to be taken off the ballot. Maybe they'll be offended enough to grant his request via voting, or maybe they'll vote him in to spite him. Who even knows, given how fickle the BBWAA is, but with Schilling just under the mark as is it could go either way.

BARRY BONDS AND ROGER CLEMENS: Ooo boy. Yeah, I don't think they're getting in. Not only has MLB refused to pass an olive branch to anyone confirmed to have PEDs, but Bonds and Clemens both refuse to restore their reputation whatsoever (which might actually help two other players, but they're coming later). If they get into the Hall, it will be decades from now when steroids are in the rearview mirror and both players are either pushing daisies or on the cusp of doing so. It really stinks as someone who adored Clemens as a kid, but it's also their own fault.

SCOTT ROLEN: Rolen's been on a massive upward trajectory in the ballots, and it pretty much guarantees he'll get in. If it doesn't happen this year, it'll be next year for sure. 

OMAR VIZQUEL: Remember when I said genuine criminals shouldn't be in the Hall? This is who I was referring to. And apparently the BBWAA agrees with me given his decline in the most recent ballot. Sure there's still five more years for new info on the domestic abuse to come out, and when looking at raw stats he should be in the Hall, but right now, he should not get in based on what we have. It shouldn't happen to him, it shouldn't happen to freaking Trevor Bauer, it shouldn't happen to anybody who does something like that. 

BILLY WAGNER: The BBWAA seems to not know what to do with non-versatile players who weren't constantly in the game, and that includes relief pitchers. Wagner has had a similar rise to Rolen recently, but with two extra retired years on him and slightly less votes, he's in worse shape. If Wagner does get in, it'll be two or three years from now.

TODD HELTON: Helton will get in, but he's in a similar boat as Rolen and Wagner and won't be there for a while. Not that it's so bad in his case since he has a year on Rolen. 

GARY SHEFFIELD: While not as marred by steroids as Bonds and Clemens, he also hasn't posted nearly the number of votes for him to be considered a likely candidate. He's going to fall off in the next few years.

ANDRUW JONES: If it was just his Braves career, he would have been an early pick. But the BBWAA does have to factor in the Dodgers onwards, and those numbers did not help him out at all.

JEFF KENT AND MANNY RAMIREZ: They're way too far down. Kent's practically guaranteed to fall off next year, and Manny Ramirez is in the Bonds and Clemens camp, but with stats that are ""too low"" (compared to Bonds) for any chance of success.

SAMMY SOSA: Goodbye.

ANDY PETTITTE: Also in the Bonds and Clemens camp, along with stats non-comparable to Clemens.

THE RELATIVE NEWCOMERS: I don't see most of them sticking around as indicated by the votes. While Tim Hudson and Bobby Abreu have my vote for eventual VC candidacy, Mark Buehrle wasn't that much of a standout to begin with, and Torii Hunter's relatively lacking stats - not to mention his Latinophobic and homophobic comments - will keep him out as well.

CARL CRAWFORD: He doesn't really have the stats that would warrant a spot in the Hall.

PRINCE FIELDER AND RYAN HOWARD: The BBWAA is obsessed with longevity, and it's a luxury these two didn't have. They'll stick around for a few years and then fall to the wayside, as iconic as they are.

TIM LINCECUM: With how much he contributed to the Giants and his two Cy Young awards, you'd think his WAR would be way higher than it actually is. He'll stick around a bit but will fall off soon afterwards.

JUSTIN MORNEAU: A very popular figure that also did not have the benefit of longevity.

JOE NATHAN: Stats are very low despite a solid career, and that isn't attributable to his Tommy John surgery.

DAVID ORTIZ: Ortiz is the first of the two aforementioned players who will benefit from NOT being in the Bonds and Clemens club. Despite the proof of steroids being there for all to see, and the fact that the BBWAA is supposedly allergic to designated hitters, Ortiz is such a prominent and beloved figure in baseball that he will clear all the hurdles and be elected. If not this year, then in the years after that. 

JONATHAN PAPELBON: A relief pitcher with none of Wagner's stats. Will fall off.

JAKE PEAVY: Peavy has much better stats than most of the other pitchers here, and it will allow him to stick around longer. Longevity's going to be a thorn in his side as well, though in his case it won't matter quite as much.

A.J. Pierzynski: His reputation as an asshole, coupled with ""not quite there"" stats, will keep him out of the Hall.

Alex Rodriguez: Ooo boy again. A-Rod's the other player I think will benefit from not being in the Bonds and Clemens camp - even if he has a foot in. His rather public punishment compared to the other two seems like a death sentence on paper, but A-Rod's post-career has made him a surprisingly popular figure who isn't anywhere near as defensive as Bonds and Clemens. If A-Rod continues playing his cards right, he might actually get in. Bear in mind though, it's NOT happening this year. If it happens, it'll be in his eighth or ninth year on the ballot, given how extensive and publicized his situation has been, especially compared to someone like Ortiz.

JIMMY ROLLINS AND MARK TEIXEIRA: I think most would agree that these two are great players who could and should be in the Hall. It's just not happening this year; probably around Year 5 and 6 for them.",mlb

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth‚Äôs record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I‚Äôm his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game.

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn‚Äôt find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true.

"Every year it seems like a few teams are screwed by the current system and a few are helped by it. However, you cannot argue that the current system rewards performance during the regular season. 

In 2015, the Cardinals, Pirates, and Cubs had the 3 best records in baseball. They also happened to be in the same division. This means, that not only did they have to play two of the top three teams at a higher proportion than teams outside their division, but when it came time for the playoffs the pirates and Cubs would have to battle it out in a winner take all game for the wild card spot. The 162 game body of work would come down to one game. On top of that, the team with the best record in baseball gets screwed over for having to play the second or third best team. 


This year we are in a similar situation. Are the 88 win Braves more deserving of a playoff spot than the 106 win dodgers? If the dodgers win, does that really reward the giants?

Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have all teams within a league play each other equally? Then when it‚Äôs time for the playoffs you can seed based off actual performance. 

I can understand the argument that divisions exist because of the travel requirements, timezones for viewing, existing rivalries. Still teams could easily be realigned by east/west.

"I know they're two different sports, and obviously one has a salary cap, but let's compare the below scenarios.

Los Angeles Dodgers currently have a $267m payroll. That is 2.05x the league average payroll of $130.4m and 1.76x higher than the average of the other 9 playoff teams ($151m).

I think most people would agree that spending this much more than other teams is a pretty significant competitive advantage, and thus there is the competitive balance tax. However, their tax bill is only projected at $17m, which is less than the salaries of 6 individual players on their team.

Now let's compare that with the Golden State Warriors, the NBA team with the highest payroll.

They enter the season with a $177m payroll, which is 1.36x higher than the league average payroll at $130m. A much smaller monetary advantage that will cost them $184m in taxes.

It just seams a bit pointless to even have the tax if it's so insignificant that a team can go well over the threshold ($210m) and really not have any consequences for it. The threshold for the tax being 61% over the league average payroll also seems incredibly insufficient.",mlb

"Zachary D. Rymer from Bleacher Report makes a good point about where MLB playoffs should go in the future:

[106-Win Wild Card Dodgers Should Be Final Straw for MLB's Broken Playoff Format.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10013654-106-win-wild-card-dodgers-should-be-final-straw-for-mlbs-broken-playoff-format)

&gt;**Either Make it a Wild Card Series or Use Seeds**  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the fundamental problem here is that a team as good as the Dodgers deserves more than just one playoff game, the first question might be why MLB couldn't simply expand the Wild Card Game into a Wild Card Series.  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance, [Joel Sherman](https://nypost.com/2021/09/24/mlb-playoffs-cardinals-dodgers-and-how-to-fix-the-wild-card/) of the New York Post thinks MLB should take a page from the Korean Baseball Organization:  
&gt;  
&gt;*""If the top-seeded wild card finished five or more games better than the lower seeded wild card, then rather than playing just a sudden-death game (as it is now), they would play essentially a best-of-two series in the higher seed‚Äôs home stadium in which the higher seed would have to win just once while the lower seed wins twice.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;However, a system like this wouldn't have done the 2021 Dodgers much good. Nor would it solve anything in years in which two excellent teams have to settle for a wild card, like when the 100-win Yankees met the 97-win Oakland Athletics in 2018 or when the 98-win Pittsburgh Pirates met the 97-win Chicago Cubs in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;A simpler way forward would be to have the two wild-card teams play a best-of-three series. A guarantee of two games might barely seem like an improvement on a guarantee of one, but it would at least diminish the likelihood of either contest turning into a Franken-game.  
&gt;  
&gt;As in, a game in which both teams seek out every possible advantage through frequent substitutions that make it seem like an actual chess match more than a baseball game. The [average game](https://www.baseball-reference.com/tools/share.fcgi?id=ODNe7) goes for long enough, typically lasting between 3:05 and 3:10. Between 2012 and 2019, all but four of the Wild Card Games lasted [even longer](https://stathead.com/tiny/2m46q) than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem here is that a Wild Card Series would require the division winners to sit for at least three days. Time off in baseball can be a competitive disadvantage if rust sets in, in which case division winners would actually be punished rather than rewarded.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, perhaps the best thing MLB can do is still have three division winners and a one-game playoff between two wild-card teams, but simply seed teams by their records without prioritizing the division winners. You know, like they do in the National Basketball Association.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI do like the format of the NBA,‚Äù Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said in August, according to [Bill Shaikin](https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2021-08-29/dodgers-mlb-playoffs-format-giants-rockies-nl-standings) of the *Los Angeles Times.* ‚ÄúThe two best teams, in the sample of a major league season, should have the best chance of meeting in the postseason, and not just in the first round.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;This way, teams like the Dodgers would rightfully get to skip ahead to the Division Series. To make sure division winners still get some reward, though, here's one for the ""Just a Thought"" file: MLB could allow them home-field advantage if they advance past the Wild Card Game.

And make it at least by 8 teams per league (8 from the AL, 8 from the NL). If they have to cut the number of regular season games down to either 120 or 130 for each team to make it happen, so be it.",mlb

Question for baseball heads: how much freedom do third base coaches have in making calls like waving runner home (ex: Yankees decision tonight)? Or does this manager normally determine ahead time if they want to be aggressive on the bases or more conservative?,mlb

"Lemme use an example. Runner on 1st base steals and the batter hits a high fly ball to the outfield. The runner thinks it‚Äôs it line drive to the fence so he touches second and goes to third. By the time the runner reaches third he realizes it‚Äôs a pop fly and needs to get back to first. From here I have two questions? On the way back first base can the batter just run by second without touching it? Could he even just run straight across the field, past the pitchers mound to first?",mlb

"Or any, for that matter. A midget is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as ‚Äú[s]omething that is very small‚Äù.  4‚Äô10‚Äù, to be precise. And while some of you baseball historians may point out the case of Edward Carl Gaedel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gaedel), standing 3‚Äô7‚Äù on his inconsequential tiptoes and being the shortest person ever to play‚Äîwho had a single plate appearance in which he walked on four consecutive balls and was then subbed out for a pinch-runner, keep in mind‚Äîover the years as the sport has evolved, midgets have quickly vanished from the league. Nowadays the closest person to a midget is Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros (go figure) whose statistics are 5‚Äô6‚Äù. Not at all a midget; not a smidgen of midget in the whole league. Now, why is this?

I do understand that midgets have some inherent disadvantages. They generally are quite lacking, in fact, with regard to baseball‚Äôs crucial traits of strength, speed, and intelligence (although this third one no more than normal people)‚Äîas well as, of course, height. But we‚Äôve seen midgets greatly exceed their particular expectations and excel in at least a few sports when given a fair chance. While nothing like the NFL‚Äôs football, NHL‚Äôs hockey, or NBA‚Äôs basketball has turned out all that well for them, consider Olympic gymnastics and horse racing. I... actually can‚Äôt think of any others off the top of my head, so maybe not a few sports but a couple at least. They ought to be satisfied with that. If not, maybe they‚Äôd be decent at the shot put or javelin throw. 

Anyhow.

Despite all those aforementioned disadvantages, there‚Äôs one ironically  BIG offensive advantage to being so little: The strike zone. The strike zone is officially defined as ‚Äúthe area over home plate from the midpoint between a batter's shoulders and the top of the uniform pants -- when the batter is in his stance and prepared to swing at a pitched ball -- and a point just below the kneecap.‚Äù  Recall the case of Edward Carl Gaedel. It‚Äôs evidently much harder to pitch to a midget. Even if a pitcher manages to throw a strike, a theoretical secondary advantage of the strike zone being even smaller than the midget is that it could know exactly where the pitch is coming. Furthermore, midgets would have far less bad calls against them, as umpires would be able to easily see over them--although that might not matter at all with Joe West, who I‚Äôve heard actually despises midgets but fortunately he is retiring to become a broadcaster next season. All things considered, midgets could force walks and have potential to be great contact hitters, thereby being relevant for about five more years at most.

Aside from the offensive side of the game, midgets could also be very effective on the field. While they certainly wouldn‚Äôt be great outfielders due to lack of ability to scale fences and rob home runs, or pitchers due to an increased effective distance to home plate from point of release, midgets have a ton of potential as catchers. One serious issue that catchers have is how their necessary posture puts an enormous amount of strain on their knees; this can lead to many injuries, with meniscus tears, muscle strains, and tendonitis being just a few. So here‚Äôs the key: Midgets wouldn‚Äôt have to kneel at all. They could just stand there and catch balls‚Äîtwo feet on the ground and two feet off the ground. Catching is in fact the hardest position to play, and a very important one, and for that midgets have my respect.Having a midget on your team could be, defensively, an ironically BIG benefit. Midgets should be fucking fantastic catchers. I‚Äôd love to see it.

Midgets also have potential at shortstop.

To conclude, while you absolutely 100% would not want a team full of midgets, midgets could have true niche value in professional baseball. The MLB ought to stop discriminating and give midgets a fair chance. We‚Äôve already seen midgets play at lower levels of the sport, namely little league. Yet even over the last entire decade, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve seen a single midget in all the MLB games I have watched. That‚Äôs right: Not. A. Single. One (midget).

Maybe I just missed it.",mlb

"Just as the Yankees were about to start some trouble. The Odor hit I saw a quick clip of the Yankees dugout. The Peralta guy was smirking and gesturing to a team mate, what looked like he was gesturing that the Rays were gonna give this up. The NY tv station covering this only shows that for a second before quickly switching camera. Seemed deliberate.Then soon after with bases 2 and 3 occupied, Rays choose not to walk Judge to load the bases. Which made no sense, it‚Äôs the obvious thing to do . By walking Judge they would have set up an automatic out at home with on a hit. A well run team like Tampa should know this better than anyone. Well then Judge hits the ball to 2nd baseman, who throws to home but catcher can‚Äôt tag Wade. NYY wins. If Judge was on 1st base, and say Stanton hits that ball, that would be a force out at home. 

The Blue Jays were beating the Orioles 12-2 at that point. The Hottest team in the league. A team that gave Tampa trouble recently. While Tampa has owned NY and Boston pretty much. Now Tampa faces either of these team instead of a surging Blue Jays team.

Who will clinch the division, go to the NLDS &amp; have the best record in the National League this year? And who will be demoted to Wild Card to face off against the St. Louis Cardinals in a 3-game series?",mlb
"Alright all.  I'm here with my nerdy spreadsheets so we can have ourselves a nice, concise, easy way of seeing how everything will go based on tomorrow's results.  This will be cross-posted in the main MLB page, and in all teams that need to know how their fates lie.  If I got any details wrong, lemme know.

With Seattle's victory over The The Angels Angels, they are still in the hunt for one of the two AL Wild Card spots.

All games begin at 3:05ET.  There are four teams left in the hunt.  The standings can be found anywhere, but here's the basic lowdown.

In terms of tie-breakers, it depends entirely on how many teams tie, and how many spots there are.

|TEAMS TYING|1 SPOT|2 SPOTS|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2 TEAMS|Game 163, hosted by team with better head-to-head record. **(Scenario 1)**|Both teams advance to Wild Card, team with better head-to-head record hosts. **(Scenario 2)**|
|3 TEAMS|Teams would choose A/B/C designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other two gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record.  Team A hosts Team B, winner goes to Team C, winner of that goes to Wild Card. **(Scenario 3)**|Teams would choose A/B/C designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other two gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record.  Team A hosts Team B, winner goes to Wild Card, loser travels to Team C, winner goes to Wild Card. **(Scenario 4)**|
|4 TEAMS|Teams would choose A/B/C/D designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other three gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record, then the third.  Team A hosts Team B, Team C hosts Team D. Winners play in the ballpark of the superior head-to-head record within them.  Winner of that game goes to the Wild Card. **This has mathematically been ruled out.**|Teams would choose A/B/C/D designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other three gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record, then the third.  Team A hosts Team B, Team C hosts Team D. Winners go straight to the Wild Card, hosted by the team with the better head-to-head record. **(Scenario 5)**|

If it seems complicated, I get it.  The easiest way to think about it is as a mini one-game tournament bracket, and the teams with the best record get to pick where on that bracket they go.  Now the big question is ""In the event of ties, who has the best head-to-head record?""  Thankfully, this one's rather easy.

|\---|BOS|NYY|SEA|TOR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BOS|\---|10-9|4-3|10-9|
|NYY|9-10|\---|5-2|8-11|
|SEA|3-4|2-5|\---|2-4|
|TOR|9-10|11-8|4-2|\---|

In short, the order of head-to-head tiebreakers will be as follows:  **BOS &gt; TOR &gt; NYY &gt; SEA**

**WHAT THIS MEANS:**

* The **Red Sox** control their own destiny, and ARE guaranteed at least Game 163.  If they win, they are in the Wild Card.  In the event of Games 163/164, they will either host or get first choice of team designation.
* The **Yankees** control their own destiny, and ARE guaranteed at least Game 163.  If they win, they are in the Wild Card.  In the event of Games 163/164, they will not get first choice of designations, and will only host Seattle.
* The **Blue Jays** DO NOT control their own destiny, and require a loss by either the Yankees or Red Sox AND a victory in Game 163/164.
* The **Mariners** DO NOT control their own destiny, and require a loss by either the Yankees and Red Sox, AND a victory in Game 163/164.  In the event of Games 163/164, they are at the whims of all three other teams.

So now comes the fun part:  How do we get to each scenario based on tomorrow's games?  Fortunately, I have a nice little spreadsheet all prepared for this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

|OUTCOMES|BOS-W, NYY-W|BOS-W, NYY-L|BOS-L, NYY-W|BOS-L, NYY-L|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SEA-W, TOR-W|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 3**, (TOR&gt;NYY&gt; SEA)@BOS|**Scenario 3**, (BOS&gt;TOR&gt;SEA)@NYY|**Scenario 5**, BOS&gt;TOR&gt;NYY&gt;SEA|
|SEA-W, TOR-L|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 1**, (SEA@NYY)@BOS|**Scenario 1**, (SEA@BOS)@NYY|**Scenario 4**, BOS&gt;NYY&gt;SEA|

|SEA-L, TOR-L|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize everything, here's what you should root for to get the best outcome (either the cleanest path to the wild card game, and/or the bumpiest road for the opponent):

* **If you are a Red Sox fan,** you want the Red Sox to win, Yankees to lose, and Mariners and Blue Jays to win.
* **If you are a Yankees fan,** you want the Yankees to win, Red Sox to lose, and Mariners and Blue Jays to win.
* **If you are a Blue Jays fan,** you want the Jays to win, the Mariners to lose, and either the Red Sox or Yankees to lose, preferably the Yankees.
* **If you are a Seattle Mariners fan,** you want the Mariners to win, either Red Sox or Yankees to lose, and Blue Jays to lose.
* **If you want maximum baseball, maximum drama, or are a Tampa Bay Rays fan,** you want the Red Sox and Yankees to lose, and the Blue Jays and Mariners to win.",mlb

I say let the #1 seed pick who they want to play in the divisional series. They earned the right, and it will make for some more tasty rivalry if a team gets picked because they are perceived as an easier target.

"Not being a Yankee fan, I never listen to their games. However, like many, the AL wildcard race has been interesting‚Ä¶so I‚Äôve been bouncing around between AL games for all of the contenders.

Usually I would be watching them on MLBTV, however I was driving so had to listen to their radio broadcasts on the internet Most of the teams seem to have comparable broadcast teams‚Ä¶but OMG - what the hell is up with the NY Yankees radio broadcast team?

They seriously could have raffled off tickets to random fans and had more interesting broadcasters! The play by play guy sounded like he is older than my grandfather and we were keeping him up past his bedtime! The so-called ‚Äúcolor analyst‚Äù was a woman with the personality of wet cement‚Ä¶and offered absolutely NOTHING in terms of analysis! A few bitter comments because the Yankees were losing turned into complete sullenness after the Rays added the last two runs in the 9th.

I expected the broadcasters for the Yankees, of all teams, to be very slick, polished  and ultra-professional! I couldn‚Äôt  have anticipated these two in my worst nightmare! New York and the Yankee organization should be utterly embarrassed!

I thought they would be the BEST broadcast team in baseball‚Ä¶.instead they are without a doubt THE WORST I have ever heard! I watch and listen to a lot of minor league games as well‚Ä¶and I swear to God, our Sacramento Rivercats (SF Giants AAA team) have better broadcasters than they do!",mlb

"I don't think that any team that has won 105 games (or more) has ever finished second in their division.  If the Dodgers win at least 2 of 3 vs. Milwaukee, and do not catch SF, they would be the first. And if they do catch SF, then the Giants will be historic losers. 

As a Giants fan, I doubt that would compare to the pain of 1993, when SF  blew a 10-game lead vs. the Braves, won 103 games, but still finished 2nd in the NL West to the 104 win Braves, and missed the playoffs. (Historical note: only three other teams in baseball history ever won 103 or more games and failed to make the playoffs: 1909 Chicago Cubs, '42 Brooklyn Dodgers, and the '54 Yankees.) 

I know people are talking about the Yankees and the AL WC race, but this NL West race is insane.  I cannot recall a divisional race with two teams that both appear to be on pace to win 105+ games closing with such hot streaks. I mean, the Dodgers have been red-hot, winning 15 of their last 18, 83% winning percentage trying to close this gap with SF. But SF have had a closing kick of their own, winning 19 of 23 themselves, which is also an 83% winning percentage (ok, I rounded up from .826%).

"I'm starting to gain a little interest in baseball again for the first time in almost 15 years. I grew up a Red Sox fan in the '00s. Probably watched an average of 150 games/yr from '02-'08 before I gradually started to lose interest in the game (Manny was my favorite player, and once he was traded I started to care less about the Sox).

I'm noticing a ton of players across the league bat in the \~.190-.220 range, lots of guys strike out a ton. I remember back in the day when Adam Dunn was flirting with the 200 strikeouts in a year range, it was a huge deal. Now it seems like even some of the best players in the league get close to that mark. In hindsight, I was probably spoiled by witnessing the primes of all time greats like A-Rod, Manny, Pujols, end of Bonds career, beginning of Miguel Cabrera's career, Vlad, Papi, etc, but all those guys would routinely bat .300 with 40 homers and be closer to 100 k's/yr. Same story with batting averages, I don't remember seeing a non-pitcher start an entire year batting .200. Now I'm noticing a lineup might have several guys batting under .220.

Am I just misremembering the game because I was a fan of a relatively stacked team and witnessed a bunch of all-time greats, or has the game changed in some way that averages are a lot lower and K's are a lot higher? Better pitching, greater emphasis on slugging over average, etc?",mlb

"I'm a Mets fan, and last year, SNY started using the strike zone overlay that is on pretty much every broadcast now. I hate it, but I seem to be in the tiny minority on this one. Oh, well, I guess. It's definitely not going anywhere any time soon. 

Does anyone know of a way to watch games without this? Any online feeds?

(if anyone is curious, I dislike it because it's not imparting any information to me. The zone itself is irrelevant live, as only the ump's call matters. Further, it's covering up the live action and makes it more difficult to see catcher positions and the little dot they put up covers where the catcher catches it. On top of it, most pitches are not borderline and most calls are not controversial, so it's telling me literally nothing for the vast majority of pitches. Anyway, rant over)",mlb

"Can someone explain baseball rules to a total newbie who is not from the US. I can't find normal explanations anywhere and I refuse to believe that it is that hard to grasp a concept of the sport.


-What is an inning? How much time does 1 inning lasts? Do both teams play during the same inning or only one team per inning? How many batters and how many pitchers can play during 1 inning? Can pitcher from one inning throw ball during some other inning too?

-Can you score points without hitting Home run? How do you gain points? Is home run always 2 points? You can only score points while you are a batting team, right?

I've watched couple of full games on youtube and ot seems to me that the players are switching on random. I still didn't caught the pattern on which they switch.

I think that people only need to explain this sport better for it to become more popular or for people to think it is not boring. Sport looks cool to me but all the explanations are so weird and in my country no one is watching or knows anything about baseball.

"1) An agreement could never have been reached in December or January. Period. If they reached a deal in December, the media would have spent the last 2 months declaring one side the winner and criticizing the other for reaching a poor deal with so much time left to negotiate. This would have happened regardless of how fair the deal really was.

2) I support this entire process and, while bummed the season is now delayed, fully support negotiations between organized labor and ownership. I will continue to support profitable ownership and profitable employment because both are vital to ensuring the league continues to exist. I am a fan today and will continue to be a fan whenever the season starts again.

3) The season may not start for several months. The CBA negotiations are about to get complicated by owners introducing a service time reduction for the 2021 season due to missed games. I expect that card to be played by the owners if more games are canceled. When it gets played, I expect the players to walk away from talks for an extended period of time.

"If people actually bothered to understand what the lockout is about, they would see that the players are asking for too much. The main issue is Super-2 eligibility. 

If the players had their way, more young players would qualify for super-2 status and earn service time faster. They want 75% of young players to qualify, whereas the MLB has refused to budge from 22% where it has been for decades. If the MLB accepted the MLBPA's proposal of 75%, or even the MLBPA's second offer of 35%, this would mean that instead of  your team controlling your drafted players for 6 years (3 pre-arb years + 3 arbitration years), your team would only have the drafted player for 4-5 years. If your favorite young player wins ROY or MVP, they also gain an additional year of service time, and thus the player reaches free agency even faster. 

This would be TERRIBLE for small market teams and hence why manfred is adamant about keeping the Super-2 eligibility the same. The MLBPA's proposal is good for the player, because he will reach free agency faster and stand to make more money, but bad for the small market team that can't afford them, and bad for the game of baseball. I'm all for players earning more money, but not when it *completely ruins the competitiveness of baseball.* 

The players also want the CBT to be higher, making it easier for large market teams to spend and harder for small market teams to compete. But the players *don't care* because they stand to make more money if the bigger market teams have more cap space. Good for players, bad for the game. 

And yet everyone is taking the players side because ""OwNeRs GrEeDy"". It's quite the opposite actually. The players will sacrifice the competitiveness of the game for a few extra zeros added to the paycheck. Don't believe me? The overwhelming majority of them have *already* left your favorite small market team to go sign the biggest contract offered in NY or LA, and it will only get worse under the MLBPA's proposal. The players say ""we care about the fans and fairness of the game"", when we already know they all eventually leave for the money. It's clearly not about the game, it's about the money. And now they are using their fame and popularity to gain the fans trust and bully the MLB into making a deal that's bad for the game of baseball.

I don't see how anyone who roots for a small market team can take the players side here. Under the player's proposal, the Guardians would have had Lindor for 4 years instead of 6, and somehow they are supposed to compete in a 4 year window around that player, when it was hard enough for them to do it in 6. You see how quickly he left Cleveland and signed with NY? Did he take a smaller contract ""for the fans and fairness of the game""? No, he left town and followed the money immediately. 

The Cubs would have had Kris Bryant for two less years. And KB would have been free to sign with a team who's luxury tax cap was increased with no draft pick compensation going to Chicago. How is this good for the Cubs?? Draft a stud, only have control of him for 4 years (not long enough to build a team around), and watch him leave for LA to take the money, while the Cubs get almost nothing in return. What's the point of the minor leagues and a draft if you're only getting 4-5 years of control on a player? 

Not only has MLB offered to increase young players salary, they have removed draft pick compensation from free agents, they have changed the draft order to avoid tanking, and are openly willing to expand playoffs as well as increase the share of revenues to players. They are even willing to raise the CBT, like the players want. They just won't budge on Super-2 eligibility and I am on their side for this one. I see no way in which increasing Super-2 eligibility is good for the game of baseball. 

If you have any thoughts on the matter I would love to hear them. I am open for healthy debate here. I've been watching the lockout for months. The fact is, the MLB has made several offers inching closer and closer to the player's side, but the players keep getting more and more unreasonable in their demands. What makes me upset is seeing the players use Twitter to denounce the MLB in an attempt to get the fans on their side, when all the fans have to do is understand the issues at hand to see why MLB won't *and shouldn't* budge.",mlb

You are flawed, as is the human race.  You have an asshole Commissioner, far to many idiot Owners who care only about profit, and not winning, and many other issues.  

But, we have the crack of the bat, 100 mph fastballs, pristine fields, towering taters, and amazing double plays.  These things belong to us, and no matter what you do to make our lives worse as fans, one day you won't be around, while baseball will remain.

I hate that I love you, but will not cut off my nose to spite my face.  There are a millions products we buy, where the owners or parent company are giant fuckheads, we just don't see it or know about it.  At least your transparent about you disdain for the fans.

It is beyond disappointing you couldn't solve your issues in a timely manner, but nothing you do shocks us anymore.  I hate you Owners, but love you baseball.",mlb

I‚Äôm from New Mexico and I‚Äôm trying to get into baseball. We don‚Äôt have a team and I‚Äôm looking at the Rockies and the diamondbacks. I heard the Rockies are struggling but the Db are decent. Almost feel like db is the best choice since nm has a lot of rattlesnakes lol. Really just trying to watch some good baseball.,mlb

Does anyone know or have a source on what the home and visitor gate split is in MLB games ? I.e. how much of the gate does the home team keep and how much does the visiting team get ? I can't find this anywhere. I think football is 60/40 but can't find what it is for baseball.,mlb

Of course, the NBA players struck (if that is the right word), during the 2020 playoffs for social justice.  I‚Äôm otherwise referring to the animosity between Owners and Players that that MLB has enjoyed for more than 100 years.",mlb

"2022 will be at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles well assuming there even is a season but if the season gets canceled 

Then 2023 MLB season it would have to go to LA 

Then 2024 it would have to go to Seattle 

But then 2026 we know Philadelphia will host it


But for 2025 as far as who should host, I would go with Toronto at Rogers Centre because the last time we hosted an MLB All Star Game or had All Star festivities here in Toronto was 1991...some would argue that we are overdue for an All Star Game


But then 2027 onwards:


- 2027 I would go to Chicago at Wrigley Field
- 2028 I would go to MetLife Stadium in New York/New Jersey 

- 2029 I would go to Globe Life Field in Texas
- 2030 I would go to Fenway Park in Boston",mlb

"  I'm 61 and been a baseball fan since 1968.  For the first time I'm considering to just be done with MLB. I was looking so forward to the 2022 season it felt like the next era was just beginning for the game. In the end though it is just a game. 

  As a family and mostly Cubs fans we returned to attending ballgames last year after a four year absence due to ticket prices. Last year in groups of 7 to 15 we attended five games in Cincy and Chicago.  Parts of us attended an additional 12 games in Cincy, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, (there is a Braves fan in the family).  Tickets, food, souvenirs, restaurants, gas, airline tickets and motel rooms were purchased. That's a lot of hard earned cash for a middle class extended family to spend and we'll we were looking forward to expanding on that this year. With our April 2nd outing now unlikely and time pressing our scheduled family outings we've now decided to explore and commit to other options.  We surely can't be the only ones. 

  It's very sad but I'm afraid this is a new era alright. The beginning of the end for our national pastime. I mean they've already really have pretty much excluded middle class families from their fanbase by the expense of attending ballgames. Not to mention already having excluded the lower middle class and below previously. I'm disgusted and disappointed MLB and MLBPA. Just a thought as you fight over your share of millions and billions, but if you lose the middle class your going to eventually lose millions and billions. Good luck, tears and likely good riddance.",mlb

"Players Union crying over more $$$ while the rest of the country is suffering. Greedy buggers. 

Players are paid only during the regular season, accruing 1/162nd of their salary daily. Players would be subject to losing as much as $232,975 daily in the case of Mets pitcher Max Scherzer, or as little as $3,441 for a player at a $640,000 minimum.

Guess MLB is of my watch list",mlb
