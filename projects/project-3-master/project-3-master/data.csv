Hey everyone I am a Freshman in college attending San Jose state and I am just wondering what is the best way to get into sports analytics?,1
"As I'm sure you have heard, the [MLB recently cracked down](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-foreign-substance-crack-down-six-things-to-know-about-baseballs-sticky-situation/) on pitchers' use of foreign substances. Using Baseball Savant, I have noticed that many pitchers have seen noticeable declines in RPMs for almost every pitch. 

I would like to see the statistical significance of these declines. 

For example, on June 10th, [these were the declines of Aroldis Chapman's](https://imgur.com/a/O0Pjnl0) pitches on the blown save versus the Twins. 

What would be the easiest way to determine if these drops are statistically significant? 

Here are some other examples:

"Trying to do some analysis in R with baseballR. I had been using the built in functions to scrape Statcast and Baseball Reference Data for pitchers. When I go to join in a player's name based on the ID, I always get a match but get the WRONG match. It literally seem like BBR and Savant have been using the same set of unique player ID values, but randomizing which player belongs to each. Am I stupid or just high? It always matches a pitcher but a DIFFERENT pitcher who is not even on either team.

"Hello guys, I’m back to ask a few questions, I work with my schools baseball team and they said that they wanted me to include outcomes in my markov chain, as in, just simulating pitches wasn’t enough they wanted to know, what kind of pitch sequence would produce a specific outcomes, such as an out, strike, etc.

In other words, what sequence of pitches has the highest probability in yielding a specific outcome.

My first through was to use a hidden markov model, saying my hidden states are pitch types “fastball, curveball, change up, slider”, and my observed variables are the specific outcomes (strike, double play, out, etc)

That way I can get the sequence with the max probability of yielding a specific outcome that’s observed. 


For example the coach told me “our main pitcher had 7 strike outs one game using the same sequence of curveball,slider, curveball, and he usually has a weak curveball, so we don’t know how that happened but if there’s a pattern between what outcome there is and the specific sequence, we want to know which sequence had the highest chance at yielding strikes or outs”


So would this be a good opportunity for using a hidden markov model? Any other suggestions?",1

"Hi guys. I'm trying to work on a project to compare the true talent levels of different division I college baseball players, and I am running into a problem that I may be overthinking, but I need some advice. I am currently in the process of collecting all the data baseline stats (hits, HRs, K's, normal counting stats), and with those, I can then calculate more advanced stats such as ISO, wOBA, FIP, etc. My issue with these stats is that each conference premieres a vastly different level of performance. For example, maintaining a wOBA of .400 in a league like the SEC is significantly more impressive than a .400 wOBA in the Horizon League. This would be similar to if the scoring environments were different in the AL and NL in the MLB, but they are not different enough to warrant different statistical measurements. In college, however, they are, and it is even more apparent this season, where many conferences did not allow a non-conference schedule.

A common solution for this is to use league-adjusted stats like wRC+ that control for league and park effect. These stats seem to be made for exactly my scenario (and they may indeed be what I'm looking for), but there is still something about them that I am still struggling with: A wRC+ of 150 in the SEC should also be more impressive than a wRC+ of 150 in the Horizon League. 

Basically, I am looking for stats that are not as much league-adjusted, but more opponent-adjusted or environment-adjusted. I feel like the league-adjusted stats should account for this, but I still feel like I will run into the problem I describe above. Am I missing something about how league-adjusted stats work, or are there some other stats I could use to fix this issue? Also, if anyone else has worked on a project like this I would love to see what you have done! Thanks!",1

"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to derive wOBA for a fictional fantasy baseball league, and have come across a functional question about RE24 and baserunner/out situations. I will try my best to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's say that an inning is led off with a home run in the first PA, starting off with bases empty and 0 outs. Then, in the next PA (with bases empty and 0 outs again), a batter hits a double, and he would be the only other run to score in the inning.

&amp;#x200B;

As I have it right now, the expected runs produced for no runners on and 0 outs would be 3, because the first situation with no runners on and no outs resulted in one run on the play and one run to come in the inning, and the 2nd PA resulted in one run on the play and no runs later in the inning, hence the count of three.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is, for duplicate baserunner and out count situations in the same inning, do you just take the highest value and discard the duplicate? If not, it would result in a higher expected run count than there are total runs scored.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope I did an adequate job of explaining my problem, any feedback is much appreciated.",1

"I've been working on a research project that analyzes team data from 1996-2019 and tries to build a prediction model that can predict the team's win total based on their other stats.

"Hello!

I am currently working on my master thesis and need WAR data from 2015-2020. I've found some data on different sites as baseball-reference and ESPN but i there are some obstacles.

1. Some sites only have e.g top 5 players (with regards to WAR)
2. Some sites demand web scraping ( time consuming, and messy)

My question is, are there any places where it is easy to download this kind of data?

&amp;#x200B;

note: I am new to baseball and sabermetrics, and have downloaded full dataset from statcast(all the variables available on the website). Are all the variables needed to calculate war in that dataset? There is a lot of different names for variables in sabermetrics and it is hard to have a complete overview for a rookie as me. If all the variables are in the dataset i dont have any problem calculating it myself.

Thank you",1
"With pitching stats, it’s easy for the stat to not accurately reflect the player. For instance, everyone knows of the issues with ERA. There are stats that try and deal with the issues that others have, but they all have some weaknesses. I had an idea for a stat that I think would eliminate a lot of those weaknesses. 

My proposed stat would be very similar to FIP in purpose, but different in calculation. Instead of relying on a league average number and then having an equation, here is how my stat would be calculated:

For every ball hit into play, a system analyzes all the different factors of the ball, especially velocity and position. Then it calculates whether or not the league average player would be able to field that play. Then it assigns a value to that ball put into play based on how likely it is to be fielded. It will also be weighted for how many bases the runner is expected to get on each play. The system’s purpose is to analyze every play and determine what the average outcome is, in order to judge the pitcher correctly.

I know it’s kind of lame to end this here without any proof of concept or even any numbers, but this is a hypothetical stat. I wish I knew how to code, because then I could work on this, but alas I cannot. I figured I should share it though in case it sparks anyone else’s imagination or if anyone wants to try and make this",1

I've had a statistical modeling project going for several years now. My goal is to create a model that (reasonably) accurately predicts MLB hitter performance in the upcoming year. This began as a final project for a stats class I took while I was in college and is something that I've updated and improved every year. 2 months into the season I'm fairly happy with my results. These two charts show my results, and I added Statcast's xwOBA for reference (interestingly, xwOBA from 2020 has only been a fraction of a percentage point more predictive than a hitter's wRC+ from 2020, which is supported by previous years results as well. I think Statcast has a lot of interesting data, but I think all of their xStats for offense are junk). These charts include all MLB hitters who received at least 50 PA's in both 2020 and 2021. It's worth noting that it may not be fair to compare my model with xwOBA, since xwOBA only includes 2020 data, while mine is using the previous 6 months of baseball (7/24/2019-5/24/2021). I haven't found a way to find a batter's xwOBA over a multi-year timeframe. However, limiting my model to just 2020 data still results in an R\^2 value of about 0.095, which is still quite a bit more predictive than xwOBA. Based on previous year's data, I predict that my model will have an R\^2 of about 0.22-0.30 at the end of the season for hitters with a minimum of at least 200 PA's in both years, compared to xwOBA, which is usually 0.13-0.15.

The model was created differently this year. Previously, I would take as much data as I possibly could for hitter's of a selected sample size, as well as the hitter's wRC+ in the following season, and create a regression model predicting the next year's wRC+. This led to a ton of bias in my results, and my actual R\^2 each year was maybe \~60% of what my predicted R\^2 was. This year, I took all hitters who compiled a minimum of 1000 PA's in the Statcast era, and used data such as swing rates, contact stats, and sprint speed to predict the player's wRC+ during that time period. I consider this to be a ""true talent"" calculation. I used the regression formula calculated by that model to create a prediction for what every player (min 250 PA's in two consecutive seasons) should have done in year one, and then took that prediction along with other variables (such as handedness, age, park factors) to predict how that player performed in the following season. This resulted in a significantly stronger fit with much less bias.

There are some issues with the model. The range of predictions it gives is almost entirely in the 80-120 range, which is obviously much narrower than is seen in a real season, and makes me question how useful the model actually is, since the difference between an average prediction and a positive prediction is so slight. Additionally, I've noticed a weird trend where the model seems to predict hot streaks. For example, last year Dylan Carlson was bad, but the model said he'd be good this year. This year, Carlson has been good, but now the model says he won't sustain it. I've noticed this trend with a number of other players in previous seasons as well. I don't have data confirming this, and I don't know that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it is an interesting observation. I also think the model probably weights batted ball data (barrel rate, etc) too heavily, which makes me think some of it's predictions are bound to regress and makes me wonder how quickly it'll stabilize, but FWIW all test I've done indicates it stabilizes much quicker than xwOBA or the previous years data. And then lastly, it is a very simple model. I think this is both a good and bad thing. My regression analysis professor stressed that the best model is always the simplest one that gets you closest to the max fit from the data you have, but I do wonder if a more accurate and useful fit could be achieved by increasing the data used by the model. Currently, I think it only uses like 10 total variables.",1
"I’m keeping track of stats for my softball team, and trying to measure offensive stats. The problem is this league has a HR limit of 4 per game. So it’s important to hit them strategically. If we’ve reached our HR limit it automatically counts as 3 outs. Therefore if someone uses up 4 home runs for solo shots, it can harm us later in a game. But at the same time if it’s late in the game and we haven’t used them up yet, a solo shot can also help. 

I know OBP is generally agreed upon as the best stat for measuring offense. But in this league Selfish players hitting solo shots should not have as high of a OPS as someone that is getting on base more. 

What adjusted formula would you recommend using? It would be nice to come up with the ultimate stat that also factors in runs scored and RBI’s into this to show overall offense value",1
"Hi, have had this thought in the back of my mind for awhile but never asked:

How does the calculation for inherited runners work? Cause I was doing some digging and found something that doesn't quite make sense to me.

All calculations I've found for for RA9 are basically ERA but get rid of the distinction between earned and unearned, that's great I agree for the most part, but it seems like runners left on base that score because of a reliever get charged to the pitcher who left them there and not the pitcher who allowed them to score which doesn't really make sense to me since it allows another player to affect your value (however small) and allows a relief pitcher to allow runs scoring without taking any type of hit to their value (however small). The Pitching WAR page on baseball reference doesn't acknowledge this situation.

Blake Treinen has his RA9 based on 6 runs allowed during 19 innings pitched this season for an RA9 of 2.84. However he allowed an inherited runner to score on 4/24 that got charged to Victor Gonzalez and doesn't at all count toward his RA9.

I get that WAR is designed to be context neutral, but it seems like a potentially big issue for that context neutrality if you had 2 pitchers who had similar lines and left runners on base when they existed games but one had a lights out bullpen while the other has a terrible pen. If RA9 is calculated like I think it is, then doesn't bullpen quality have the potential to affect a pitcher's bWAR in a significant way?

I'm sure in the grand scheme of things it doesn't have any significant effect on players... but it does seem like there is potential for a huge mismatch in specific circumstances... maybe we should grade relievers on how well they strand inherited runners (ala the extra innings RA9 calculations) and give pitchers a league average strand rate when calculating their RA9 instead of using the actual runs charged to them? 

Thanks for any clarity y'all can provide.",1
"First post here and hopefully not the last: I love the statistical side of baseball and have spent a lot of time lately diving into the data. I love how data can tell a story that is often missed by most.

If anyone has a model or a link that allows you to input a single game performance, I would love to play around with it. I know there are so many factors that go into WAR, so I am interested in what drives WAR day to day.

"I'm picking up [my old project](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/aqfrqo/moonshot_demo_visually_simulating_where_each/egfpq6n/) to simulate where baseballs would end up in space if massively accelerated.

"Fake hypothetical question:

Rather than just formulating an opinion-based answer to the question based on judgement, is there a stat that measures the ""RBI Opportunity"" of a given stretch? 

If so, we could tabulate how ""juiced up the bases were"" for any given player over the course of the season. That would give us a better context for evaluating the accomplishment of their traditional stat (e.g. RBI).",1

"I want to keep this post generally vague - as details would make me easily traceable in a niche community. However, a month ago I officially left the sports industry in favor of a more stable profession, and I felt the need to vent after much frustration. 

I worked with several teams in several departments, ranging from MiLB video guy to front office intern. I was never a full-time salaried employee, but from an entry level perspective, a lot of that is luck, timing, and who you know. I’m not too upset. I know people much less qualified than me (and got fired mid season when at an affiliate) who are now analysts and conversely dudes way beyond me (crazy physicists and folks who could get jobs with Google or NASA).

And that if I didn’t catch a break, working with a tech company would allow me to stay around the game and work more manageable hours. So, I got a job. It was steady for a little and then COVID hit. And again, without being too specific, the way I was treated sort of from Day 1 was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me.

I was blatantly misclassified for tax reasons. The people in charge were brilliant, but awful business people. The technology was amazing. It was cool to be on the ground floor of a smaller rising operation (they’re all small and gaining clients exponentially). But, one day you’d be promised no issues with furloughs or that they will fulfill the terms of your contract. The next day, you were furloughed for months on end and at the end of your contract, you were told that you couldn’t be paid your last owed check until the following year. 

Companies were hit hard in this industry by COVID. But, the lack of human empathy just baffled me. I was furloughed for quite a while, and as I was frustrated I wouldn’t be receiving my last paycheck, I saw my company posting about adding more clients, giving entire systems away, and getting all this good press. It wasn’t just me either. An entire new team of hires was dropped suddenly. Everyone was promised communication but never heard again after furlough. Dropped. Many MLB teams who had to drop interns or seasonal employees brought them back into the fold in 2021. I was promised more due to my experience and waited a long time. No word. Nothing around Christmas, nothing on New Years to forecast what’s up, nothing before teams went to camp. I let the company treat me poorly because I loved baseball and the tech. But imagine being brought on to a job, and being furloughed sucks enough. But on top of that, having NO communication ever again. None of us ever heard back. And they hired new people without ever consulting us to see if we were on the market. I shouldn’t care because I moved on, but it was crushing after all I’ve done and the reputation I built thus far. 

Then afterward, I did some digging on other companies. Not all of them. But many. Similar stories. One of the most renowned companies in the field that I spoke to this winter were one of the most disorganized work environments I’ve seen. Low pay, no career path, and your work hours are seldom better, being at the beck and call of teams. Who are immensely needy to the point I’ve had friends tells me with companies that they’d have to start reports at 10pm after wing promised 9-5 hours. Teams are fun to work for directly, not on the outside.  

I know this was long, I need to rant. I felt really hurt. To be told great job and then ghosted. Even if a job goes poorly, you get fired and it’s closure. These companies just are profoundly awful. Not ALL of them, but after a lot of research and talking to folks, it felt prevalent. If you want to work in baseball, just be with a team. Intern, go in with the risks. At least then you know what you signed up for. But for those who thought like I did that being around baseball with these companies is a good replacement, it’s not. It’s all the bad things about being with a team in a completely soulless atmosphere.",1
"On baseball savants csv definition page it's plainly defined as ""Vertical movement in feet from the catcher's perpsective"" but this doesn't align with the ""vertical movement in inches"" that is shown on player profiles.  Wherever I look for more info I see it defined differently like actually being in inches and/or being relative to a pitch without spin measured from 40/50 feet from the plate.  I've also seen that the effects of gravity are taken out of pfx_z.

pfx_x correlates perfectly to pfx_x * 12 = horizontal movement in inches but trying to do this with pfx_z results in incorrect values.  Does anyone know of an updated/true definition of pfx_z or a formula to get inches from it?",1
"Whenever I'm looking at a player on Baseball Savant and Fangraphs I often wish I could see what the league averages are for specific stats.  Savant has the wonderful percentiles at the top for everyone, but I really think it would be useful to see specific numbers quickly when making comparisons.  Example:  Lucas Giolito has a 72nd percentile K% which is 27.8%.  League average is clearly lower but if there was like a bar below his stats bar that was a list of ""League Average"" for every stat man that would be handy.

Anyone do this often?  Have any tips for ways to do this?  Does someone make a browser script or plugin that does this that I can't find?

"
Elvis Andrus has always been mediocre. I have to say that because from 2009 to 2012 he was an average to above average defender but since has been an outright below average to poor defender. If you’re a casual fan and take a look at his career slash line of .272/.328/.370 with a 14% K rate you may think ‘well there’s a okay hitter’ but then you pull back the curtain a bit and peek at his wRC+ and see he’s only been an *average* hitter twice. The reality is he’s been a cap casualty ever since 2018 when he was 29.

I’m not writing this to say oh look at his wRC+ it hasn’t been good therefore ‘he bad.’ The same thing you find with Elvis Andrus is the same thing you find with Albert Pujols or Chris Davis or Khris Davis or any number of hitters. I have found roughly 3 major ways of being able to project whether a hitters best days are behind him before we are faced with the startling reality at the plate. The most common key to expected regression is looking at Pitch Value/100, after aprox. 3,000  career plate appearances if a guy has a season in which two or more pitches he sees more than 2% of the time have a value of -1.4 or worse and an overall CSW of 25%+ then congratulations you’ve found a hitter scheduled for regression. 


Chris Davis experienced it in 2016, a season in which he finished with 38 HRs, the following year he regressed to a 91 wRC+ before absolutely collapsing. Khris Davis experienced it in 2018, a year in which he had 48 HRs and has since been very not good. Pujols succumb to it in 2017, a year in which he had already regressed from the previous due to a different regress commonly found in older hitters. Elvis Andrus experienced it in 2018, a season which appeared be a simple regress to the mean for a fairly young player but was in fact a sign that his usefulness at the plate was close to over. 


It’s worth noting that going into 2020 two of the biggest disappointments in Christian Yelich and JD Martinez showed no signs of slowing down, and given they both saw less than 250 plate appearances it shouldn’t be indicative of their future at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

Going off 2019 stats here are some guys expected for this type of regression:

&amp;nbsp;

Lorenzo Cain – Brewers – Current wRC+: 90

Manny Machado – Padres – Current wRC+: 105

Freddy Galvis – Orioles – Current wRC+: 116

Jose Abreu – White Sox – Current wRC+: 130

&amp;nbsp;

Im interested to follow those 4 and see how their seasons turn out. Hope you enjoyed this! I’d love to write some more down the line of projecting breakouts for hitters or pitcher regression",1
"So I used to play mlb the show franchise mode to try and use sabermetrics and statistics to try and build the best team, etc., but I have been really disappointed with the game this year.

"Does anyone know how to create a similar radial plot using Trackman data in R like this in the link below? 

https://link.medium.com/zrwlZPkAegb",1
"Any current or historical examples you can think of?  

My favourite historical example is Joe DiMaggio. He was erroneously called the ‘greatest living ball-player’ and lionized by the New York media. Had he played elsewhere he would not have been as much of a cultural icon. In that sense, he was OVERrated. 

However, he also happened to play in a park that handicapped him more than any great righty power hitter, ever. 

His career splits at the ol’ Yankee Stadium: .315/.391/.546

On the road: .333/.405/.610

Gosh, was that park ever death for right-handed hitters in those days. Joe D, for what it’s worth, out-averaged Ted Williams on the road and slugged only .005 worse. Granted, the OBP was substantially in Williams favour, but still! Some people consider Williams the greatest hitter ever and JD hit with as much power as him on the road. I can’t think of an all-time great more penalized by their home park. I wonder about the approximate effect it had on his career WAR. If he played in practically any other park and didn’t lose 3 seasons to WW2 I think it’s plausible he’d have amassed 110-120 career WAR. 110-120 WAR in 16 years would be incredible. For that reason I think he’s a tad underrated by the analytics community, which tends to rank him in the low 20s nowadays. 

One might say, ‘park factors! They adjust for this stuff’ — well, no, not quite. OYS was a graveyard for righty power hitters, but on aggregate it was not a pitchers park. The short right field porch benefitted lefties substantially. It does not adjust for handedness. 

Now, while I’m a SABRhead I deviate a little from some orthodoxies when ranking players by placing more importance on skill and adjusting for vagaries and happenstance than some. Yes, career value is the most important thing to consider, sure. But, I look at someone like DiMaggio and can’t help but think his skill level exceeded his statistics or accumulated career value (which is legendarily great even with 3 lost prime seasons, 83.6 fWAR) and not for nebulous reasons like ‘he just didn’t live up to his potential’, ‘his head wasn’t screwed on right’, but for some freak anomaly that is 

a) quantifiable 

b) not adjusted for by overall park factor and thus not reflected in his career WAR

c) wholly out of his control 

Does DiMaggio magically become a better or more skilled baseball player if he hits at, say Fenway his entire career, where he hit .334/.415/.605 (80 points better than his OPS at home against the Sox)? No! He also doesn’t win all those World Series. Yet, he becomes orders of magnitude more VALUABLE. And that applies to him playing in every other American League park than the one he was unlucky enough to hit in. 

While one can also say ‘b-but he should have adjusted!’ — that’s technically true but pushing the limits of what is reasonable to expect from a right-handed power hitter playing in a home park historically unsuited to his talents. Rings similar to ‘pull yourself up by the bootstraps’ — obvious advice, but hollow. No righty power hitter did. Joe Gordon was LESS of a power/pull hitter than Joe yet he ‘adjusted’ as poorly, if not worse. 

The inverse of this is Jimmie Foxx. He is unanimously remembered as the better hitter, and maybe he was (it could be that he adjusted his swing to his park to such a degree that it radically altered his road stats) but look at his home/road splits: 

Home: .345/.454/.664 

Road: .307/.405/.560

Joe has 50 road OPS points on him. They are both right-handed pull hitters, but one played in offensively robust parks for righties, the other did not. Taking their overall stats at face value and pretending one adjusted and one did not seems like willful ignorance. Joe is a better hitter and a top 10-15 all-time player, not top 20-30 or any of that jazz. I know gifting unearned career value is like printing money, but I can’t ignore my eyes here and pretend Joe D. is in the Jimmie Foxx tier all-time.  


Just my (radically unorthodox) take. 

TL;DR: Joe D. is better than his stats suggest but not cuz of ‘aura’ or ‘Yankee mystique’, it’s cuz through sheer misfortune he played in a park historically tough on righty power hitters which is unaccounted for by park factors. 

What are some other examples of this?",1
"I've spent today reading about CSW% and it seems like a really interesting stat for pitchers.  What I can't find is any information about how to use the stat to evaluate batters.  I haven't seen any articles about CSW related to hitters but in the search function on Fangraphs, there it is.

Anyone have any insight on how to use this stat to evaluate hitters?

And on this topic, can anyone give any insight as to why the CSW% listed on Fangraphs and the same numbers when you use the search function on Baseball Savant are different?  For example:

"Hey guys,

So I'm currently trying to derive linear weights in a fictional fantasy baseball league that I play in, but I hit a snag in [this fangraphs tutorial](https://library.fangraphs.com/the-beginners-guide-to-deriving-woba/) on how to derive it. To save y'all the time with having to load the page, here is the paragraph:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Scaling

\&gt; We have the runs above average for walks (0.29), HBP (0.31), singles (0.44), doubles (0.74), triples (1.01), and home runs (1.39), but what we want to do now is put wOBA on a scale that will look like OBP. In OBP, an out is worth zero, so the first thing we want to do is adjust the run value scale so that an out is equal to zero.

\&gt; There is an easy way to do this. First, we need to find the linear weight for all outs using the same method we used to find the value for the other events. We’ll call it -0.26 for 2015. This means that an out is worth -0.26 runs less than the average PA when it comes to run expectancy. What we want to do now is add 0.26 to each of our run values so that outs are equal to zero. So for walks, which we said are worth 0.29 runs above average, we bump those up to 0.55 runs *relative to an out*. Using linear weights, walks are worth 0.55 runs more than outs. We repeat this for each of the five other positive offensive outcomes.

*(Something I should note, I am only collecting data in the 8th inning and earlier to avoid walk-offs that leave incomplete innings.)*

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should I do? My best guess would be to collect the sum of all the negative RE24 plays and divide it by the sum of all the outs made, but that doesn't sound right (A double with the bases loaded that scores two runs but the runner from 1st getting thrown out would be an out-producing play, but still generate positive RE24). So, I'm just looking for other tutorials right now and thought it would be a good idea to make a post on here because you guys have been so wonderfully helpful in the past on my prior account.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated, thank you!",1

"Hi guys I am working with Statcast data on the granularity of every pitch thrown. How can I determine whether a pitch was in or out of the strikezone? I know that the data shows the x,y coordinates of where the pitch's location was, but I am also curious about the ""zone"" variable.

When looking at zone visualizations on Baseball Savant's website, it shows the standard strikezone of 9 squares, with 4 outside-the-box zones of up-and-in, up-and-away, down-and-in, and down-and-away. That adds up to 13 zones, but when looking at my data, there are 14 zones. What's the discrepancy?

"I’ve been recently downloading data using the pybaseball

    team_game_logs()

function.  This function returns data regarding each game of the season, based on year and team.  For example,

    team_game_logs(2021, ‘NYM’)

will return data for each game of the Mets 2021 season so far.  Batting results are the default returned values, but my searches have been ‘pitching’ to return pitching data by each game, such as 

    team_game_logs(2021, ‘NYM’, ‘pitching’)

The data includes typical pitching stats, such as IP, H, R, ER, UER, BB, etc.  The last column from this download includes a column, ‘PitchersUsed’, which lists the pitchers that played in the game and they are listed in the order in which they appeared.  Additionally, each pitcher has more information specific to them.  Most obvious are the letter codes, W for win, L for loss, Sv for save, and so on.  However, the pitchers have numbers listed before any of the letter codes.  For example, when looking at the data from the 2021 Mets, the first several games of the ‘PitchersUsed’ column includes

    J.deGrom (99-71), M.Castro (99-H), T.May (99-L), A.Loup (99-BSv)
    M.Stroman (99-63-W), M.Castro (0), T.May (0), J.Familia (99)
    D.Peterson (99-27-L), J.Barnes (99), D.Betances (99), J.Lucchesi (99)
    T.Walker (99-58), M.Castro (1), T.May (1), E.Diaz (99-W)
    J.deGrom (4-82-L), E.Diaz (1), J.Familia (3)
    

The first row is the first Mets game of 2021.  The pitchers for the Mets, in order, include deGrom, Castro, May and Loup.  A.Loup blew the save in game one.  However, I cannot find any information regarding the numbers in the parentheses, such as J.deGrom (99-71).  The numbers do not appear to correlate with batters faced, number of pitches thrown, innings pitched, number of strikes/balls, pitcher appearance for the year, etc.  I’m stumped because I don’t know what these numbers refer to.

&amp;#x200B;

The pybaseball library does not include any information about these numbers, that I can find.  This data comes from, I believe, Baseball Reference and I cannot identify any information from their website regarding these numbers.  In fact, it looks like Baseball Reference may also get historical data from Retrosheet, and again, I cannot identify any information about this through their website.  The first numbers of the year (in the example above) all have 99 as the initial number listed, such as M.Stroman (99-63-W) in the second Mets game of the season, which is his first appearance of the season, and in which Stroman got the win.  This 99 appears to be a code for the first appearance of the season for the pitcher.  After that, any obvious sequence evades me.  In fact, some of these identifying codes are listed as single numbers, like J.Familia(3), while others are dashed, like J.deGrom(4-82-L).  In searching of BR, Retrosheet, and pybaseball docs, I have not found any list of codes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any insight to what these numbers refer to, or where a list of codes is located?  I’m puzzled.",1

"So I am pretty much trying to create a statistic that acts like a war since player's war is only available for season stats (my program uses past week and monthly stats).

metricB = (wOBA + metricA) /2                              -&gt; Average of metricA and players weighted OBA

metricC = (SB / PA) \* .10                                          -&gt; SB per PA with a minimal weight applied

playerScore = metricB + metricC

As a result I get the following which I feel does a good job of showing how a player does ""PER PLATE APPEARANCE"": however I would like to be able to create a weight based on number of plate appearances

"I decided to create my own baseball stat to evaluate players on a 10 point scale based on a player's On Base Percentage, Total Base Percentage, and the percentage of time the ball is put in play (excluding double plays). I used these numbers on some current and past players to evaluate their seasons. I found that an average score was around a 6.65, so someone in the 6 range is average. I found that Mike Trout's MVP season in 2019 was an 8.28, so someone in the 8 range is an MVP level. This is also backed up by the fact that JD Martinez currently has a score of 8.22, which makes sense because he is having an excellent season. Lastly, I wanted to find how high the score could go. I found that Ted William's 1941 season scored a perfect 10.04, which I figure is the absolute best someone could do. (The only season higher was Barry Bond's 2004 season in which he got a 10.41, but for obvious reasons his numbers are thrown out). 

My overall goal was to find an average of a team to determine whether that team's performance was equal to their score. I was wondering if any of you found this premise interesting, and if so could you let me know. Thank you for your time.",1

As I mentioned on my previous post, my name is Juanito Banca ( Johnny Bench in english ) and I've been working with baseball data for more than 5 years now. Mostly with StatsApi ( previously using XML's, now JSON's ). Few months ago I decided to found Beisbol Analitica, a community that between other things is focused on teaching analytics/coding/sabermetrics to people for free.

One of the projects that BA has started working on a MySQL that contains play by play, pitch by pitch data for MLB, LatAm winter leagues( LBPRC, LBVP, LMP, LIDOM ) and Mexican leagues(LMB). On top of that, the database contains (open source) stored procedures that calculate interesting such as REM24, Run Value, wOBA, FIP, Win Expectancy, Park Factors and aggregated data(at several levels). This way by having both the data and the code, people can carry out their own analysis and can understand( and most importantly, reproduce ) advance stats.

As of today we have data from 2006 to 2020 and the way we get the data is by using MLB's StatsApi. By doing so, we have access to some awesome information( which ofc we store in the database) like:

* Pitch Type ( MLB only )
* Pitch Location( X, Y coordinates)
* BIP location( X.Y coordinates)

Hello all, I’m a student working for my college baseball team doing some analysis on their game data. We have scraped game data for the team from the NCAA website and are interested in the pitch sequence. The current data contains stats such as the specific pitcher, the outcome, batter, order number, hitter number, inning, whether it was top or bottom, and many others.

We have been tasked to take this game data from 2019-2021 and try and find some relationship between the variables and pitch sequences.

An example, one of the rows of data contains “KBFK”
In the pitch sequence column, indicating that as the pitch sequence, ( I don’t watch nor play baseball so I don’t know what this means, I’m just helping from the stats side).

Now that I have given some context, I will give u ab idea of my plan, without getting too technical we want to figure out which of these variables are mostly predictive of, or have some sort of relationship to the pitch sequence, obviously data cleaning will be done before any model fitting, but my next question is

What else besides knowing a pitch sequence could be useful? Cool we find out that on a given hit or batter the pitch sequence KBFK occurs, but what more can we do with this?

Can I maybe go deeper and predict the next pitch? Or the pitch on a given situation?

Like i said, I don’t watch baseball, I just know numbers and how to extract insights from data, but I need to know if what I’m doing is helpful, and where I can go further.",1

(e.g. A 6 run lead in the 1st with 2 outs and runners on 1B and 3B).  In this case, sd(abs(WPA)) returns NA).

During the MLB season, they have some periods where they do not put out a new file, like the All Star Break. They also don't put out WAR data for the first 8-10 days of a season; I'm guessing that is to establish a decent sample size and weights.

But there are also individual days where they don't put out data, which occur on a fairly regular basis—typically Mondays. I have a project where I want to use the daily WAR data, but the gaps in continuity make it a little tough. I'm trying to figure out why BR does that.

One theory I have is that Mondays tend to be travel days for teams, and there are fewer games that day. So perhaps a disproportionate number of good or bad teams playing that day could throw off weights? That doesn't seem right, though, if enough data underpins the weights.

My other, best theory is simply that Monday is just their day off at BR.

Any ideas?",1
"Follow-up post to original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/p6ipr4/does_weighting_previous_seasons_increase_the/

I've made changes to my methodology to address the issues that commenters raised. For one, I've switched the sample from 2018-2020 to 2016-2018, using 2019 as the dependent variable instead of 2021. This addresses both the issue of the 60-game 2020 season, as well as using a full season of data for the dependent variable rather than the in-progress 2021 season.

Next, also on the recommendation of /u/jamminontheone, I've switched the weighting from 5-3-1 to 5-4-3, as Tom Tango's Marcel projections proposed in 2004.

Here were the results of the regressions:



Test Case | R^2 | Std. Error | t-value | p-value
---------|---|-------|-------|------
Naked Total (1/1/1) | 0.469 | 0.050 | 5.635 | 2.1e-06
Weighted Total (5/4/3) | 0.474 | 0.012 | 5.692 | 1.8e-06

These numbers make a LOT more sense than my initial attempt at analysis. The statistical significance of both test cases is much stronger, in both cases exceeding a confidence level of 99.999%. Both also have a stronger correlation with the dependent variable.

We see that weighting the seasons on a 5/4/3 basis provides a slightly better correlation, with almost a 5x reduction in the standard error. Obviously a +- 0.05 to wRC+ isn't an issue since it's usually represented as an integer value, but clearly weighting does provide a statistically significant advantage for projection purposes, if a small one.",1
"Hey all, I've been getting more and more interested in ranking systems and recently read about 538's Elo model for baseball [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-mlb-predictions-work/). My question is about the ""Preseason ratings"" section, where they say they take PECOTA, FanGraphs, and Davenport wins and scale them to Elo to help make a team's preseason rating. What does this mean mathematically? How are they doing this? Appreciate the help!",1
"I guess the title kinda speaks for itself. Both the rays and the astros are specifically hiring operational analysts experienced with Stan and good with markov-chain modeling and Bayesian reasoning. I understand this is a somewhat generally applicable field of data science, but those are the only FOs I’ve seen demanding those particular requirements at all and they’re demanding them heavily. Is this a new cutting edge that other teams are yet to catch up on?",1
"One thing I've seen recommended in the Fangraphs Library is that when using a player's statistics to try and predict their future performance, given a sample of three seasons, those past three seasons should be given weights of 1, 3, and 5 from least recent to most recent season, to account for the fact that a player changes over time.

To test this, I loaded up R Studio and baseballr and pulled the seasonal wRC+ stats for batters that qualified in every season from 2018 to 2021, giving a sample of 37 batters. I've performed two linear regressions using the 2021 wRC+ of these batters as the dependent variable; the first regression uses the regular mean average of the 2018-2020 seasons for that batter as the independent variable, and the second regression uses the weighted mean where 2018 is weighted 1, 2019 is weighted 3, and 2020 is weighted 5. Here are the results of these regressions below:



Test Case | R^2 | Std. Error | t-value | p-value
---------|----------|-------|-------|-------
Weighted Average (1/3/5) | 0.111 | 0.171 | 2.085 | 0.044
Regular Average (1/1/1) | 0.156 | 0.206 | 2.547 | 0.015

What we can see is that the weighted average has a lower correlation than the regular average, contrary to what Fangraphs' recommendation would suggest. The p-values show that the recommended average also has a notably higher level of statistical significance, and is well within the 95% probability threshold.

Am I missing something here, or did Fangraphs make a mistake suggesting a weighted average for career stats?",1
"Curious to see how you can find out what the most common occurrence is, does b-ref offer a tool for this?

Does anyone know where I can find a leaderboard on stuff+? I can only find one thing about Seattle Mariners pictures but I am looking for a leaderboard on it to see who leads the league,1
"So, I’m doing a pretty simple project to show how hitter behavior has changed. Rise of the TTO player, increased LA/EV, etc. I know those metrics are pretty dated in that home runs are down this year, effects on the baseball, etc - but for the sake of the visualization project, it’s good enough.

I’m trying to think of a good way to visualize these changes beyond a simple line or bar graph. I want to display some kind of league wide change in pull, power, LA, really anything. I’m familiar with doing spray charts, heat maps, radial graphs for individual players - but it’s obviously harder to see change from the league as a whole.

With that, any recommendations of effective means to communicate how hitting behavior as a whole has changed, something you could put on an infographic. Simple, but kind of baseball-themed. I’m just drawing blanks how to visualize those league trends in a creative, aesthetically pleasing way.

I am using bars and lines elsewhere, but want to find a way to viz an overall change in some capacity - either in past decades or 2015 Statcast era",1
"Hi, I was looking at the FRAA leaderboards for catchers on Baseball Prospectus and when I click on the catcher’s profile it shows a different number under the 2021 season then what’s on the current leaderboard. Why is this? Which number do I look at? Sorry if this is a dumb question I’m kind of new to this.",1
"When a leadoff hitter gets on base, it seems to me like this is more valuable than a later hitter getting on base. They often hit with no outs, and they hit with the best hitters in the lineup directly behind them. This means that when they get on base, they are very likely to score. I would think that war undervalues great leadoff hitters like Jeter and Ichiro as a result.",1
"I am curious if there is a significant difference in pitcher performance when the pitcher is distracted by a runner who is a threat to steal.

The simplest way to define this would be to look for statistically significant differences in batting outcomes broken down by runners on base &amp; outs, but also broken down by whether the pitcher makes a pickoff attempt during the at-bat.",1

"For some time I’ve played around with FanGraphs WAR calculation to better understand how it works. Recently I’ve modified it some to see what would happen with the results.

First was substituting our UZR for OAA as the defensive metric. I really enjoy the idea of OAA and what it represents. 

I also thought about it and didn’t think that the defensive and offensive metrics shouldn’t weigh the same. When you have a player who accumulates 600 PA but only makes 300 attempts at fielding the view, shouldn’t the batting weigh more? All I did here was get the percentage of plays for offense and defense, divided it by .5 to get a modifier. Here is an example:

Player A has 561 PA and made 495 attempts in the field. That would mean this player is responsible in 1,056 plays, 53.1% offensive, 46.9% defensive. Dividing each percent in half, offensive side gets a 1.063 modifier and defensive a .938.

Using that, this would be the new fWAR equation:

(((Batting Runs + Base Running Runs)*1.063)+((Fielding Runs + Positional Adjustment)*0..938) + League Adjustment + Replacement Runs) / Runs Per Win

I ran each of these individually and together to compare it to the FanGraphs way of doing it against the four big SS who will be free agents at years end and it was interesting to see the changes. 

The modifiers had far less of a play in these calculations — but only depending on what you use for the number of attempts. Since I was using OAA, I used the attempts that baseballsavant had listed. However if I used Plays listed under FanGraphs, it went from a near 50/50 split to 75/25 favoring offense. 

Using OAA, however, made a large difference. Someone like Javier Baez who had a 10.0 UZR in 2019 but a +32 OAA at SS would see 2 full wins added to his total. Likewise, Trevor Story this year has seen nearly a full win drop off his total using OAA. 

Anyhow, just wondered what this community thought about this and if anyone else has tried any such things?",1
"I am currently working on a project for which I need pitch-by-pitch data with the x-y-coordinates. Statcast is perfect for this.

The problem is this: When I go to the Statcast search page and click on ""Download Data as Comma Seperated Values File"", only the last 40000 pitches are downloaded and not every pitch! Is there any way to download all the data, or do I somehow have to download all the data separately and then merge the data into one file?

"Let me preface all of this by saying that I am little more than a baseball fanatic. I am an avid reader of books surrounding the current state of the game (Big Data Baseball, Future Value, etc.) I also consume around thirty hours of baseball podcast weekly ( Effectively Wild, Rates and Barrels, etc.) and am really enamored with that game as a whole as I’m sure most of you are. With that being said, while I find todays advanced metrics fascinating, I do not have a full scope of this area of the game as the people in this community do. I don’t even know what R and python really are but I find the idea of running numbers myself really interesting. But enough about all of that, here’s what I’ve come up with. 


You’re all familiar with the Quality Start metric. 6 or more innings, no more than 3 runs surrendered. But what makes up those starts? Innings. 

QIP. Quality Innings Percentage. 

How does one determine what a quality inning is? Here’s what I think.

-15 pitches or less

-No more than one BB

-No more than one hit

-2 or less base runners in general?

-No earned runs

-No hard hit balls or barrels

What I think something like this would bring to the table is a pretty decent snapshot of a pitchers efficiency and dominance throughout the course of a season. You could look at there QIP at home vs. away. Day games vs. night games. How that number moves through the duration of 162. Does fatigue reflect in these numbers, etc. 

Now I would like some brutal honesty and some constructive criticism from the number gurus in this subreddit. Is this a redundant stat? Does it offer anything new? What could be done to make it operate better? And lastly, what in the hell does the formula look like? I have thought about this constantly over the last week and am really just looking to start some dialogue on this idea. Thanks for reading!",1
"I am working on a university group project using R where we are trying to predict the outcome of a batted ball based on exit velocity, launch angle, and distance.

I have been looking into using CHAID decision trees to get a more accurate prediction but can't find much online as we didn't learn it in class. In addition, what other models could we run to complement our current predictions? Essentially I don't think our current project is enough, need to expand our current model by incorporating a new method or by complementing it by analyzing a different data set etc.",1

I have a basic understanding of python and will continue to learn more throughout computer science. I also plan to start learning R this summer. I have memorized most of the stats found in Fangraphs glossary and am well versed with lesser known stats that Fangraphs doesn't include. I plan on taking computer science as a major in college and statistics as a undergraduate.

"So, I’m 26. I worked in baseball a few years and between Covid and the schedule, I had to back away. A lot of it was “analyst” work at affiliates. I don’t know if work with a team will ever come back to me, but I still love the data and stats. I’m not a genius or whatever. I have a biz mgmt degree. But I went back for CS so I’d have more lucrative options. I’m still probably pretty dumb though. A lot of math confuses me, but I kind of just go with the flow, use online resources and get by.

I took a linear regression modeling course this semester and loved it. First intro to real data science. My current job doesn’t really give me opportunity to grow here. I’m waiting til I’m closer to graduating before having more CS/DS jobs sorted out. Regardless, I don’t want to not be building models for months and forget about it. I’d like to expand upon this skill set.

My class was basic, but helpful. I know things like interaction terms, multicollinearity, etc. Again, I’m not probably that smart. But I throw a lot at the wall sort of based on gut and go from there. Not great at the core math. Maybe I’m not meant for it. But I’d still like to try doing some baseball models. Just no clue where to start or what questions to ask. Baseball or not, I’d also like some models built for interviews one day, although I’m sure they won’t be that impressive given scope of competition.

"Basically, I wonder if any given batter has a better chance of getting hit in their first try against the same pitcher or in a second or third go-around until the bullpen comes in.

I can't find anything here or on pro baseball reference that points to it and that could really be interesting to prove or disprove whether it's better to pull a starter on the first cycle of the batting order once a certain number of hits are on the board.

Off the top of my head, I feel as if it has to rise cumulatively as the hitter gets more used to the pitch selection but this could be one of those counterintuitive things where they actually do better on the first frame.",1
"I was fiddling around today was looking for a convenient way to accurately rank offensive performance without resorting to computational analysis. Knowing that the key issue with OPS is that OBP is underweighted compared to SLG, I was wondering if simply adding in AVG to the mix (AVG+OBP+SLG) would improve it.

Superficially, it roughly weights BB/1B/2B/3B/HR in the same broad scales as LW with 1B being overweighted and 2B being underweighted. However, this seems to a convenient canceling out of effects for players that do not have abnormal 1B/2B ratios.

Anyway, I realize that I am not the first person to think of this, so I am wondering if any studies have been done about the relative accuracy of AVG+OBP+SLG (or more simply AVG+OPS when OPS is available) compared to more advanced metrics.

The reason for this is that I always seem to have a slash line available for players everywhere, but none of the variety of more computationally-depedent metrics. So if AVG+OPS has a 90% correlation to those metrics, that would be very useful to know.",1

"Hi, I'm a baseball fan from Mexico who's interested in statistics, sabermetrics and all these new things that are coming out and changing how we see and play baseball. However, it seems like the leagues this side of the border (namely, Liga Mexicana de Beisbol and Liga Mexicana del Pacífico) haven't caught up, or at least there's no way for the general public to see these kind of stats (on sites like Fangraphs, Baseball Savant and others).

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to at least attempt to calculate a couple of these advanced stats, at least the ""basic"" ones like FIP and WAR. So, after some searching online, I found I can look up play-by-play reports from LMB games starting in 2007. My question is, how far could I be able to get just with this data?",1

"I am trying to dive into defensive metrics to analyze players at each position but I am quickly becoming confused. 

In my comparison, I am looking at Austin Riley and Nolan Arenado. Nolan is largely considered to be the best defensive 3B in the game and has been for quite some time. Riley is an up and coming star with (to the eye test) above average defensive ability. However, if we look at their defensive #'s, they don't tell a clear story.

rPM attempts to quantify the ability to convert a batted ball into an out and Fangraphs has Riley as a MUCH better defender in this category. The same is said about DRS for Riley.

Looking at UZR however, this would indicate that Riley is a well below average defender at 3B. UZR is more widely used as the go to for defensive ability as it combines 

What factor am I missing here? Is this just a case of ""defense is too hard to quantify in baseball""? What other metric should I be looking at to analyze and compare defensive ability? Is DRS more reliable because it accounts for factors that UZR does not such as GFP/DME, ball velo/angle, etc.?",1

I am currently doing a statistics project for one of my classes where I am looking at different pitching metrics of Cardinals pitchers from this season before and after June 3rd 2021. I have noticed that for some metrics, like swinging strike percent and hard hit percent, there is not an entry for every game that the player pitched in.

For example, Genesis Cabrera pitched in 26 games before June 3rd, but there are only 20 entries on Baseball Savant for his swinging strike percent. Should I take this to mean that he had 6 games with zero swinging strikes, or that there is not data on 6 games?

"I was arguing with my Dad earlier about how wrc+ works, and showing him that based on park and era adjusted stats, Babe Ruth ranks as the most effective hitter in history. However he had a take on the stat calling it bullshit.

His argument is that those factors dont take into account the fact that some players, ex pitchers, back then had to go work a job in the day, exhaust themselves, then go to the field and play 9 innings, making them not play to their full capacity. While players like Babe Ruth dont need to work every day to make a living, giving him time to practice and play better every day.

Anyone?? Anywhere?? Where did this stat go from 2 years ago?,1
"I've been learning about change point detection, and wanted to try applying one of the algorithms (specifically, Bayesian Online Change Point Detection) to a real world question. Very quickly, the BOCPD model basically takes a set of input variables and asks, what is the probability that the ""run length"" - time since the last change point is equal to x at each time step. If the highest probability run length is zero, you have a change point.

The idea is this: The underlying talent level and run scoring dynamics of MLB aren't really going to change year-to-year. The yearly changes we see in, say, league OBP are likely just fluctuations around some ""true talent"" level. This will of course drift over time, but that process should be pretty gradual. However, there may be discrete changes - expansion, rule changes, a different ball - that change either the league's talent level, or run scoring dynamics.

The practical use of this might be that we can take the eras of offense, if they exist, and fit linear weights for wOBA specific to that era, rather than that season. We wouldn't expect the weights to be very different than those calculated for a single season - again, the idea is that baseball doesn't really change much - but they might be different enough that we could think of wOBA calculated with the era weights as a kind of expected wOBA (except not in those terms, exactly, because statcast).

**Results:** I ran the BOCPD algorithm in R with input variables R/PA, OBP, ISO and K%. I only used 1950-present and excluded pitchers as they're just terrible hitters and aren't part of the pool we want to compare position players to. I chose these to represent aspects of offense - overall run scoring, moving the line vs power, and putting the ball in play. Are these the best choices? Maybe, maybe not. I did try other combinations of variables just to see, and the results weren't meaningfully different. The algorithm [identified 1963, 1994, and 2010](https://imgur.com/a/zjDvTB4) as change points.

What that image shows is:
* scaled input variables, scaled for the sake of the algorithm and to be shown on a common scale
* the probability distribution of run lengths at each time point. Red dots are the maximum probability run length at each step.
In both graphs the dashed vertical lines are the identified change points. The first two change points coincide with a year following expansion, which would make sense. The shading above and below the red line in the bottom graph shows that the model puts some weight on possible change points before and after 1963. It is very sure about the change points in 1994 and 2010.

That the two expansion change points alter offense in opposite ways, and that it only picked up on two of the five expansions (not even the double change of expansion and lowering the mound in '69) makes me a little skeptical that this isn't just picking up noise. 

**Linear Weights:** But just in case it's not totally meaningless, I fit linear weights for wOBA for the eras delineated by those change points.

|Era|lg OBP|HBP|BB|1B|2B|3B|HR|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1950-26  |.340|.585|.566|.722|1.016|1.311|1.682|
|1963-93  |.327|.553|.530|.691|.986|1.267|1.657|
|1994-2009|.341|.616|.591|.7455|1.050|1.342|1.686|
|2010-21  |.324|.579|.558|.702|1.003|1.305|1.650|

The weights you at Fangraphs, I believe, are park adjusted and already scaled by the wOBA. These weights are scaled and adjusted by, well, nothing.

P.S.
I used retrosheet event files for the linear weights. I got the already parsed csv files for all seasons up to 2019 from jerryword 's [github](https://github.com/jerryword/retrosheet-csv).

Now for pitching I am mainly using Forcasted Run Average to help aid my decision with pitchers. For hitters I am not as sure on what to use. Currently, I plan on mainly using xwOBA for hitters. Now the issues here is  it's well known that xwOBA isn't a predictive stat. It is a descriptive stat that can be used as a predictive stat (as Tom Tango puts it). Now my idea (which I haven't put much thought into) is make leaderboards that would use FRA or SIERA as the formules and make them for hitters. My reasoning is that this has been done before (xwOBA being turned into xERA) so why not do it in reverse because FRA and SIERA have good predictive values towards next years ERA so if you rescaled them to wOBA's scale might it have a better predictive value of next season wOBA then xwOBA. Again haven't thought this out too much but this is just the premise.

Also if you know better stats then xwOBA for fantasy baseball or predicting next seasons wOBA please comment.",1

"Hello community of /r/Sabermetrics

I am trying to replicate a research paper from Christopher A. Parsons ([""Strike Three: Discrimination, Incentives, and Evaluation""](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.4.1410)) to evaluate Umpire biases towards non-white players with recent data. 

I noticed though that their measurement of player ethnicity is flawed because they use birth places to determine who is Hispanic, Asian or African American. Example: ""Players \[...\] are classified as Hispanic if they were born in: Colombia, Cuba Curacao, Cominican Republic \[...\].""  
This to me seems wrong for obvious reasons. 

Is there a better way to determine player's ethnicity or even a data set? I was looking into the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) package but couldn't find the information.

"**About Baseball Analitica**

As I mentioned on my previous posts, my name is Juanito Banca ( Johnny Bench in english ) and I've been working with baseball data for more than 5 years now. Mostly with StatsApi ( previously using XML's, now JSON's ). Almost a year ago I decided to found Beisbol Analitica, a community that between other things is focused on teaching analytics/coding/sabermetrics to people for free.

One of the projects that BA has started working on is a MySQL that contains play by play, pitch by pitch data for MLB, LatAm winter leagues( LBPRC, LBVP, LMP, LIDOM ) and Mexican leagues(LMB). On top of that, the database contains (open source) stored procedures that calculate interesting things such as REM24, Run Value, wOBA, FIP, Win Expectancy, Park Factors and aggregated data(at several levels). This way by having both the data and the code, people can carry out their own analysis and can understand( and most importantly, reproduce ) advance stats.

**What's new in the v3 of the Database**

* WSBC data.
* Caribbean Series data.
* Dominican Summer League data.
* Transactions data
* Battery Fielding Stats

The same can't be said of 1st round baseball picks and the majors.  As a result, you're sometimes faced with a draft where less than half the picks ever make the majors.  When they don't make it, they don't generate a WAR.

"Hello, I've made multiple posts about a stat that I've recently come up with on r/baseball, and some of the commenters recommended I post about it here. I'm open to hearing feedback on if this is something worthwhile or not.

The aim was to create a stat that is simple to use and understand, with some actual merit, and not that complicated of a formula, that described a pitcher's outing as good/bad/inbetween. This is supposed to be a purely descriptive stat - if it turns out to be predictive, great, but that was not the intention. It's intended use is mainly in smaller samples, especially with relief pitchers, as a better descriptor of a player's performance than ERA or W-L records. 

Formula: x = (([sum of wOBA weights from a given season](https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn)\*times that a type of baserunner was given up in an outing)+0.2\*(SB+WP+BK given up))/(innings pitched in an outing).

If x&lt;=1, the outing was good, x&gt;=2, the outing was bad, x in between 1 and 2 means we can't conclude if the outing was good or bad.

I ran the stat for the entirity of the 2021 season, and the results can be seen in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1d3Bi6RFV1Un6-LujPYXaQ5qP9R8bxDbAcH3l-jcjo/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet. If anyone is interested in the expanded version of the spreadsheet with the 21000+ pitching lines analysed, let me know.

I was advised to compare the stat with ERA/FIP/K%, and here are the results: 

||No.|% of outings|IP|ERA|WHIP|K%|FIP|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GG|9837|46%|18180.2|0.64|0.549|29.37|2.03|
|AG|5693|26%|16574|3.72|1.365|22.2|4.25|
|BG|6011|28%|7860.1|13.81|2.885|16.21|9.46|

Personally, I like the disparity between FIP and ERA, as it shows that the stat fairly accurately describes the past, while having no qualms about predicting the future performance. Nonetheless I'd be interested in incoroporating strikeouts into the formula, possibly by making them weigh more than regular outs. The question is how much more, and does that make the stat lose its previous charm?

As I'm still not well versed in college mathematics, please advise me on what to do next.",1
"Hello everyone! Continually seeing so many creators out there creating All-Time Rankings subjectively based on personal bias, I decided I wanted to attempt to make one for an article but based off a formula. Here’s the very preliminary outline I have thus far:

(.45xJAWS/Positional Average JAWS) + (.3xfWAR/ Top 30 Position Average WAR)+ (.15xbWAR/Top 30 Position Average WAR) + (.1xMonitor/ Top 30 Position Average HOF Monitor)

Obviously, this is far from perfect, and the formula itself is subjective to a degree. But that doesn’t mean it won’t be entertaining.

Notes:
- JAWS is meant to be heavily weighted. I value the work Jay Jaffe has done in this field.
- fWAR ≠ bWAR weight due to the inclusion of bWAR in JAWS. Could be altered.
- Did positional war, but maybe only necessary to split up between hitters and pitchers.
- The monitor is obviously very subjective due to the nature of awards counting, but I believe in a tiny allocation to consider these factors somewhat in the evaluation.",1

I have been watching some YouTube videos and listening to a few podcasts on the subject to gain familiarity with common concepts. Looks like Google has hosted a few talks, Andy Andres, and Bill James turn up some good results that I have been listening through.

"I just built a bunch of code, using pybaseball to scrape statcast in python, and do a bunch of calculations. It works perfectly on my initial sample. I tried running it on everyone, and it worked fine until I hit José Abreu. Not Jose Abreu, but José Abreu, because Statcast doesn't know who Jose Abreu is. The website I'm getting the player names from does not include diacritics. How can I get around this? I tried using the fuzzy=True argument in playerid_lookup, but then it thinks the name Jose Abreu is more similar to the name Joe Abreu, who played in 1942, than José Abreu",1

"Wanted to do a small data project for school and as a result, I needed the payroll data for MLB teams in the last 10 years. I found spotrac but it only goes back 3 years without premium and was looking for any other sources that included positional breakdowns. (can just pay for spotrac to be fair)

However, my teacher asked me how I would compensate for player injuries when comparing payroll vs. wins (simple regression) and was curious if there was any way I could compensate except from using the opening day, active roster payroll to measure for injured players. Are there any sources for injury-adjusted payrolls or is this something I would have to do myself?

"Hey everyone, I'm a relatively new programmer and I recently made a python program that can identify which pitch is being thrown (fastball, curveball, etc...) through machine learning.

    Suppose you know that a player’s true talent level is either a .250 batting average or a .350 batting average. At the beginning of the season, there is a 50% chance he is in each group. The player then gets a hit in his first 10 at bats. What is the probability that he is in each group now?

Most public systems operate on a yearly summary basis and use regression models (2022 = A*2021_stat + B*2020_stat).

"A somewhat-sabermetrics related discussion post - in that I’d like to discuss sabermetric concepts in ways we can’t quantify at all from the outside. But I’m curious what this sub’s thoughts are on the importance of “feel” and communication when integrating new technologies, sabermetric concepts, etc into the day to day life of players and coaches. 

I worked in baseball as a “full-time seasonal” employee for four or so years. I suffered tremendous burnout and am a bit resentful now of an industry I once loved. I did find an avenue to stay somewhat involved, but not with a team, and I found it’s been much better. However, I feel like the one common trend I noticed that drove me up a wall in my time with teams - ranging from Low A to the bigs is just how bad teams are at communicating philosophies and technologies to initiate buy-in. And I don’t think that’s talked about nearly enough.

All of us here are stat heads - writing code, spending hours doing research, and communicating findings with like minded people. Obviously, when you’re one affiliate “intern” on the road with 25 baseball players and a coaching staff - you can’t exactly communicate the same way to do your job. I think in my time in baseball, I got very confidant that I did my job well. I have a lot of colleagues that I’m now proud to call friends. I was always asked back, got good reviews, etc. But, I’ve heard nightmare stories about video guys, technology interns, all the way up to front office staff who roved that drove players and coaches crazy, to the point they were more resentful of newer technologies and analytics. And I think the disconnect is the major way teams can differentiate themselves from one another, with most of the league adopting the same tech and office structure. 

For example, one year, we had a software developer rove. And honestly, I don’t hate the idea. I’m a firm believer that all front office staff should spend at least 3 months with a team to understand that side of operations. An office in beautiful LA is quite different than a team bus heading to the middle of Iowa at 3am. To live that life even for a little gives tremendous experience as to how to create useful resources that’ll actually be used on the ground floor. Anyway, he was in IT and made the advance reports we used daily. But we had GLARING issues with our advanced reports (DM me for details if you really want to know, but it was bad). These issues made reports impossible to convey from coach to player because the coach didn’t understand the sheet, and I had to dance around it and say it was an IT issue that I kept bringing to the front office’s attention. When the developer comes into town, he has no idea what the clubhouse culture is. He doesn’t make an effort to know staff, he isn’t communicating in a way everyone can understand, and he tries to defend incorrect data. He’s sitting in the corner of the clubhouse on his laptop. The whole time. We see no changes in these reports all year and by May, a previously open minded coach is over it - and not just those reports, he grows distrustful of all other tech initiatives. Another thing - I’ve always found coaches, barring your extremely traditional thatve been in the league for 60 years, to be open minded to hearing people out. Coaches aren’t dumb. They know understanding this stuff will get them promoted too, so it’s already an opportunity for those upstairs to build that bridge. 

Another season, we’re an affiliate team in a playoff chase. That means a lot to the guys. And that is when the team decides to roll out a new technology with absolutely no mandate on how to use it. We couldn’t even wait until the start of the second half. Two people from the third party company come to the clubhouse, gather the players, and tell them the in depth advanced details about the technology of our new training software. No player cares about that. They care about if this will help them or not and if it’s easy to do. Inherently, the clubhouse culture is one that rejects the “nerds” who come in abruptly, don’t communicate well, and then expect players to use it. Part of this is of course on the players but - Issue A) everyone cares less in a playoff chase and B) they’re only means to try and encourage use of the product was to say “So and so from the Majors uses it!” And don’t get me wrong, the tech is great, but it was dropped in our office that day and not a single person touched it because everyone forgot or thought it was stupid because of how bad the breakdown was. 

This is the stuff to me, that irritates me to no end. We in a community like this don’t have to worry so much about the human element, but I think it’s understated how important it is. Baseball is full of incredibly smart people, but the divide between analytics and players still feels very off. I’ve been with teams where it’s been quite impressive, but mostly it’s been a nightmarish undertaking to clean up a front office’s poor communication so that people I work with on a day to day buy-in to our philosophies and initiatives. 

And for instance, while we see a LOT of praise for a Trevor Bauer or a Kyle Boddy - those people, through my own experience and many others, is not that great. Everyone recognizes their intelligence, contribution to the game, and their right to be confident due to what theyve done  to change the game. But, I think we undermine people skills. There’s being a loner who does their own thing, and there’s being rude, there’s not hearing anyone else out, and there’s scolding a coworker you already pay a horrible wage to because he asked a question that could’ve been Google’d. Respect is the name of the game, and if you’re just going to get mad at someone because they grew up without your resources to understand all of these advanced concepts - you’re not doing the player or coach any service. There’s a difference to me between confidence/being great at what you do, versus being a complete handful and causing players to deepen their negative stigma on innovation. They say a revolution is never quiet - but you can’t rally the troops the way analysts and industry leaders currently do. You’ll get some buy-in, but not nearly enough. And in today’s climate, the advantage is not in bettering players who will already likely be great, it’s developing the late round/undrafted Low A guy who doesn’t have overwhelming stuff but eats innings and has very interesting numbers to where a small pitch design modification may make a world of difference. But that guy needs to trust the system before we talk him into learning a splitter. 

For example, I worked with a Driveline coach two years ago - one of the smartest human beings I’ve met in baseball. But he was universally hated because he always had his foot in his mouth. He was brought in immediately in a role of authority. And he wasn’t a bad guy, but he was tremendously odd. He always communicated info poorly to players, and once you say something wrong to the wrong guy in the clubhouse, it’s over. For pitchers and hitters. There’s confidence and arrogance - and I think the latter is more present than we are aware of. And while we can’t quantify that even by a little, I think it holds baseball back. Again, I’m confident in how I did based on all the relationships I’m proud to have, but I that was always my biggest emphasis - relationships with those on the ground floor. I think that’s worth more than solely being book smart. 

Anyway. I’m of course a bit biased. My philosophy clashed with what I found to be industry standard and felt burnout. And I’ve had bad experiences with people I share core beliefs with (rooted in analytics) because I hated how they’d communicate the message. However, I think the point stands. In an era full of numbers and spreadsheets, I think MLB front offices need to focus on communicating information and initiatives so players feel like they’re more than their spin rate or exit velocity. Personally, I think having 1-2 players at each affiliate (1 Latin, 1 American) should be consulted to be “player coaches” for encouraging these things would be a tremendous help also. Players will trust one another more than someone who comes into town four times a season. But, I think teams rely on 20 somethings who may not have the confidence or people skills to try to translate complex information that the front office also can’t make easier to understand. 

Enough rambling though. It’s just long food for thought in quarantine - and why I believe the concept of communication now is the next way teams can innovate.",1

"I’ve been thinking about this for a while. As a Bostonian growing up and a lifelong Cubs fan (don’t ask), I have a lot of experience following Theo throughout his tenures in Boston and Chicago, and there is no denying he’s a pioneer for modern-day sabermetrics and a key reason why front offices are structured how they are today. One of the best ever to do it. And he’ll have a statue outside of Wrigley. 

But, I’ve recently begun digging a bit into Theo’s work and wanted to get feedback on what others think of Theo now that the Cubs are a bit more removed from their World Series and we have 15-20 years of work to analyze. My absolute basic premise is that Theo can build teams very well through player development, but once he finds that success, he has a hard time retaining it. I believe he once referred to it as “feeding the monster,” giving into higher priced free agent flops and team cores not doing as well as projected over the long haul. 

Again, he has 3 World Series under his belt. By no means am I trying to take away from that. He is the reason I fell in love with baseball. But, we’ve seen so many Jason Heyward’s, Carl Crawford’s, Yu Darvish’s, Edwin Jackson’s etc. Not everyone will nail every acquisition on the head, and his success rate far exceeds others, but is he as capable of building sustainable success as people think? 

And when it comes to drafting, is he as good as people say? The core Cubs roster was predominantly a result of very high draft picks. He’s done well in early rounds where he’s had a high selection. But, as the Cubs began to see MLB success, the Cubs haven’t been able to really rebuild their farm on the level of the Rays or Dodgers. Which leads me to ask,  is he someone who can keep the MLB side competitive while having an ever-flourishing farm system? Or did he benefit from extremely high draft picks to build that Cubs core? 

Again - before anyone comes down on me, for every flop there’s been two great success stories. The Arrieta trade, the Ortiz signing, the Nomar trade. And I haven’t dug explicitly into numbers and performance yet. Quite frankly, we can’t necessarily quantify an individual in the front office anyway - as we don’t fully know how those around him have worked, how ownership has influenced them (asking for big signings, luxury tax, etc). But, I’m curious what this community’s thoughts on Theo are today. Is he in the upper echelon alongside an Andrew Friedman, or is he more so in that second tier, with how he‘s a bit more erratic after finding initial success with teams? 

Apologies if it’s a stupid question, it’s just a quarantine  3am thought I wish I could quantify.",1

"Pythagorean expectation, or pythagorean winning percentage is a good way to find the quality of a team past it’s winning percentage. Its formula involves the team's runs scored and runs allowed, and spits out a winning percentage that more accurately represents a team's talent. If a team’s winning percentage is .500, but their pythagorean expectation is only .480, that says that the team is overachieving, and that they should have won 48% of their games instead of 50%. This is a good formula to measure a team’s performance, but there is a flaw: all runs are ***not*** created equally. A run against Jacob DeGrom is tougher to get and more valuable than a run off newly called up minor leaguer, but they mean the same when put in the pythagorean expectation formula. Alternatively, allowing a run to the Astros is more justifiable and expected than allowing a run to the Orioles. Same deal for unearned runs; the team did not earn them, therefore they should not be put into a formula calculating how good they are, at least for them on offense. On defense, it is their fault that they allowed that error, so it will be kept in the formula.

That's my intro to something I'm doing, and I'm trying to make an Adjusted for Opponent Pythagorean Expectation (AOPE), and I would like to know if someone has made something like this before, other than second and third order wins.

"In all likelihood, we’ll have some semblance of MLB action this year. What it is and when it starts, who knows. But I lean 60/40 that we see an attempt. 

MiLB though? I’m almost 100% certain we won’t for the millions of logistical reasons and threats that come with that in the situation. Which obviously will radically shift minor league baseball for years to come.

I’ve been told that front office employees still maintain full salary, but all of the seasonal staff (coaches to clubbies to trainers) to file unemployment. Some teams offer $100 a month compensation and others a bit more through April. 

I know we’re all being hit hard, but team ownership is run by billionaires is doing thousands very dirty. Teams have these budgets set aside in the winter each year to allocate. And I think it’s especially wrong teams are treating seasonal staff so terribly dirty.

"Hey guys,

I was inspired by another post in this community and decided to share a metric that I have created. Basically, I've worked on and off on this metric over the course of several years, sometimes putting it down for several months while things get busy and picking it back up for a couple weeks here and there.

The stat's goal is to find an expected run total of an individual player as well as the expected RBI contribution regardless of the runners on base and where he hits in the lineup, two factors which can skew Run and RBI totals. The math is messy but here it is.

(((0.107288)\*(1B+BB)+(0.248634)\*(2B)+(0.426495)\*(3B)+(HR)\*(0.83792)+((0.248634)-(0.107288))\*(SB)-((0.107288)\*(CS)))/(AB+BB+HBP))\*1000 = Added Run Contribution

(((1B)\*0.25)+(2B\*0.45)+((3B+HR)\*0.612)+((BB+HBP-IBB)\*0.03))/(AB+BB+HBP)\*1000 = Expected RBI's

Independent Offensive Efficiency = ARC + ERBI

All of the coefficients were calculated using a Run Probability Added Matrix to find the added benefit from each particular scenario.

Using full team data, the regression model between IOE and Total Runs yields a higher R squared value then AVG and Runs, OBP and Runs, as well as SLG and Runs, yet it is is lagging slightly behind OPS and Runs. I was wondering if my metric could be improved upon in an attempt to give it a stronger correlation with runs than OPS, and was wondering if you guys had any ideas or thoughts, whether it be from a baseball side or from a calculations of the coefficients side. Thanks all!",1
"OBP is a nice statistic, yet it fails to adequately capture the true productivity of a batter: it is weighted in a manner that implies a single delivers the same value as extra-base hits.

Thus, to remedy this issue the simple adjustment of weighting hits can be implemented into the equation to create the “BGPA”, or “Bases Generated per Plate Appearance”.

The equation is as follows: ((Singles + 2\*Doubles + 3\*Triples + 4\*HomeRuns) + Walks + HBP) / Plate Appearances

This improved performance of this metric over traditional OBP is proved by its increased correlation to runs created (OBP: 0.73, BGPA: 0.84): [https://imgur.com/a/WhVVYX4](https://imgur.com/a/WhVVYX4) .

"I'm trying to download every four seam fastball thrown in 2019. The Statcast search seems simple enough: select four-seamers for pitch type and pitcher for player type and search. A total of 756 pitchers that threw at least one four-seamer show up, led by Lance Lynn.

"I’ve been thinking about FIP as a stat. It’s supposed to be fielding independent, hence the name, but it seems like FIP relies on three categories, BB, Ks and Home Runs.

It seems like there’s an argument to be made that none of these are really fielding independent. A good outfielder can save some home runs now granted, it’s rare, but in the grand scheme of things so are home runs, so a couple of good outfield plays could really inflate a good pitcher’s FIP. 

It also seems like BB and Ks can really be affected by fielding too, because of how catcher framing can affect a pitcher’s other numbers. You can see how pitchers perform with a catcher like Mathis versus a worse framer, and it can really affect their number. I don’t even know what’s a good pitching stat if FIP isn’t.",1

"Hi guys!

Just a quick random question: I'm in the middle of a career change, trying to move into analytical roles that require more technical/coding knowledge. Due to this, I've been looking for potential data projects and I'm amazed by how much data there is in baseball.

I saw a book called ""Analyzing Baseball Data with R"" by Marchi/Albert/Baumer and wanted to know if it's the best source to learn. I already have a basic understanding of R, but need to start applying it and most courses have either fake or very simple data. I would like to know how well the analytical, visualisation, and simulating concepts in this book can apply to the business world. I also like that there seem to be chapters that focus on SQL and creating my own database. Are there any other books you would recommend?

Thanks!

"I trimmed down all hitting data since 2011 to hitters that had 5+ consecutive seasons with at least 100 PA.

First, I noticed that these group of hitters had the same rate of improvement of their BB% when analyzing by age (0.14% on average), but started at a higher baseline than all other hitters that didn't fall into that group, albeit, only slightly (+0.4%).

Second, I found a trend in the average BB% delta from one year to a next based on performance using these hitters (R\^2=.985), suggesting that all BB% stabilize towards \~8.85%.

But the 3rd and real reason I'm here is that I found an unexpected trend in the standard deviation of the performance based BB% delta that went in an unexpected direction.

The way I'm reading this trend suggests that as players obtain higher BB%, their BB% Delta's become less consistent, suggesting a wider spread of potential outcomes, both in the positive and negative direction. Meanwhile, the lower a player's BB%, the more consistent they are. This seems a little counter-intuitive to me as my hypothesis was that they'd either be about the same, or that players that had more opportunity to grow (lower initial BB%) would experience more dramatic opportunities for growth.

I'm curious if anyone has any alternative interpretations.

I am using this because I have a daily game simulator in python that uses markov chains, and I need to generate the probability slates of given pitcher/batter matchups to calculate the transition state changes.

&amp;#x200B;

To catch everyone up, in case anyone has forgotten, log5 formula when you are dealing with multiple outcomes is set up as:

odds ratio, OR = (ProbabilyPitcherOutcome \* ProbabliityBatterOutcome)/ProbabilityLeagueOutcome

inverse odds ratio (my term), iOR = ((1-ProbabilityPitcherOutcome)(1-ProbabilityBatterOutcome))/(1-ProbabilityLeagueOutcome)

Probability of a given outcome = OR / (OR + iOR)

So for a given batter/pitcher matchup you can break that down for singles, doubles, triples, homeruns, etc.  ***My question is this: How does one factor in handedness of the pitcher or batter?*** Right now I am using stats for a given batter against all pitchers. Likewise for the given batter I am using stats against all batters.  For the league I am using a plain old league average of all batting events.  

&amp;#x200B;

Should I? Could I? Break this down into more specific matchup types?  For example if its a RHP, should I generate the batter's Probability Slate using only his PA against RHPs? ***Or does using the log5 formula sorta necessitate a more general approach?***",1

"Sorry for the long post, I'm trying to make sure that I understand this stuff and am showing my work to see where I might be off in my understanding, thanks in advance. 

I understand that BBRef's oWAR and dWAR added together do not create the final WAR value, and the same goes for Fangraphs Off/BsR/Def stats. However, I don't fully understand what each of those components actually means individually

Let's look at Edgar Martinez since he's a DH his defensive value should be consistently the negative defensive value of a DH divided by the amount of games he played right? Here's his [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/edgar-martinez/1086/stats?position=3B/DH) page.

So for the 2003 season on Fangraphs he has -9.9 BsR, +22.1 Off, and -15.0 Def combining to create 2.7 fWAR. The value of a win that season was 10.158 so he must have been in total worth (win value)x(fWAR) so 27.43 runs above replacement.

The positional adjustment for his runs should be -15.0 right? I'm assuming his ""base"" defensive value is 0.0 if his adjusted defensive value is -15.0, so the -15.0 runs gets applied to each value before it's shown, is that right? 

So his value in a vacuum would be 5.1 BsR, 37.1 Off, and 0.0 Def, totaling 42.2 runs above replacement, minus the total DH positional adjustment of -15 would bring us right at 27.2 which is close enough to where hidden decimals can be the difference. Is that right? 

If so then what exactly are each of those individual values actually telling us? Each value states that it's supposed to be runs above or below average. So that would mean that a zero in each field would be an ""average"" DH. Applying the same math as above would give -15.0 runs below replacement which just isn't right so there's something I've got messed up, can you tell me where I'm getting that wrong?


Furthermore, I've got a similar but different issue with [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/martied01.shtml) and their oWAR/dWAR values.

For the same season, Edgar is worth 30 Rbat, -3 Rbaser, -3 Rdp, 0 Rfield, and -13Rpos, adding up those values together would give 11 runs, and they list his Runs Above Average as 12, so assuming there's some hidden decimals in those values, that seems to be how they come up with total Runs Above Average. Apply the amount of runs needed for a win and he is worth 1.2 WAA as stated so that makes sense. 

But where I'm getting tripped up is that his bWAR is 3.3, okay makes sense, his oWAR is 3.3, okay sure, and his dWAR is -1.2, which as he plays a purely offensive position that makes sense. So what I get from this is that his dWAR is telling us that in comparison to any replacement he is worth -12 defensive runs, it couldn't be in comparison to only replacement DHs as they have no defensive value so his dWAR value must in comparison to everyone. 

So then his oWAR shows that he's worth about 34 runs more than... what exactly? If his total bWAR is 3.3 and his oWAR is 3.3 that would leave me to believe that his oWAR is only in comparison to other DHs, but then that means that his dWAR would also be in comparison to only other DHs, but then it wouldn't be negative since DHs have no defensive value. What am I missing here? 

**TL;DR: I don't understand what Fangraphs BsR, Off, and Def run values are in comparison to. If a DH is worth 50 Off does that mean he is worth 50 more runs than a replacement DH, any positional replacement, or is it league average? See my post for why none of these three is clicking with me.**

**As for Baseball Reference, I don't understand the same components, for a DH, it appears as if dWAR is comparing the player to any replacement and oWAR is only comparing the player to offensive players of his position, again see my post for details on why and how this is screwing me up, thank you!**",1
"With the shortened season, I suspect the odds of seeing  a .400 hitter is higher but I'm struggling to calculate the odds of this happening. Any ideas for a better approach?

Here is what I calculated using my scant knowledge of statistics, although the result is probably meaningless.

Charlie Blackmon's stats through August 9:
27H / 59AB = 0.4576 in 65PA

To qualify for batting title in a 60 game season:
60G * 3.1PA = 186PA
186PA - 65PA = 121PA remaining

In his career, Blackmon walks, gets hit, or sacrifices in 9.2% of PA. 
121PA - (121 * 0.092) = 110AB remaining

To hit .400:
0.4 * (110AB + 59AB) = 68H
(68H - 27H) / 110AB = 0.3727

Blackmon would have to hit .373 over his next 121PA.

In six full seasons, he has hit .288, .287, .324, .331, .291, and .314 for an average average of .306 with a standard deviation of .020 (calculated in Google Sheets)

.373 - .306 = .067 / .020 = 3.35 z-score
(I'm trying to figure out his odds of hitting .373.)

P = 1 - 0.5 - 0.4996 = 0.0004 or 1 in 2500.

(z-score table: https://www.conversion-uplift.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Z-Score-Table.jpg)

Anyway, all I think I figured out is that the odds of Blackmon hitting .400 is still very, very low. Please criticize my crude method.",1

Or should I have multiple tables for each league/year, say \`MLB\_2019\_play\_by\_play\`?

The first way makes the most sense to me, as it seems like a simpler solution for SQL queries. The downside though, would be that the rows for league/year data set are not independent events, they are reliant on each other and there are variables like RE24 which are dependent on the whole data frame.

HR is worth 5 points, Triple is 4, Double 3, Single 2, BB is 1,SO is -1. Add those together and divide by AB and you get the TrueHit stat. I created code to add them to Lahmans and save as a CSV and then I created a separate notebook to run some basic analysis. I ran the numbers for 2019 season for players who played over 120 games and this is the top 20. Heres a link to the Github repository which needs to be seriously cleaned up lol.

"Happy Opening Day everyone! I was just looking at last season's leading pitchers and wondering (as I was at the time last summer) why Mike Minor's bWAR for 2019 was so high. He ended up with 0.4 WAR higher than Justin Verlander, who was significantly better in almost every important statistic. Just looking at the factors like ERA+, WHIP, and strikeouts, you'd think he'd be somewhere around the ~4 range, not the whopping 7.8 that he accumulated. 


What am I missing here?",1
"I'm just getting into Sabermetrics and working my way through  Analyzing Baseball Data with R and I'm not really understanding the Incremental Runs per win table provided.

I understand the 10 runs increases wins by 1 but what is this table indicating? When RS = 6 and RA = 6, the table shows 12. So if youre allowing 6 runs and scoring 6 runs, you need 12 runs for an incremental win? That doesn't sound right to me but i'm not sure how else to interpret it?

"Hello everyone, in a couple of books I've been reading (The Shift, and Smart Baseball) the authors use run expectancy matrices to argue using or not using certain calls in baseball (for example the sacrifice bunt). This always bothered me though, because as far as I understand it, the run expectancy matrix used in these examples is static, and is an aggregate from every situation with every player in the league. In practice, this matrix will be fluctuating wildly depending on who is pitching, who is batting, who's in the field, what the count is, etc. It would almost certainly be changing from game to game, inning to inning, and even pitch to pitch. Has there ever been an attempt to produce a real-time, dynamic expectancy matrix, where the probabilities are updated on a pitch by pitch basis? It seems like this would be invaluable for coaches to make informed decisions.",1

For example, I can filter that since 2016, Eric Hosmer leads the league with 39 1 out singles with runners on 2nd. That part is helpful, but I can't get the outcome of the AB (if the runners are now 1 &amp; 3, or just at 1, etc.) Does anybody know how to get this? Or is there something I'm missing in statcast?

"Hello r/sabermetrics,

I’m putting together a project dealing with specifically vertical movement of MLB pitches on their flight to home plate. This, I’m looking for a database that has information on the flight path of pitches thrown in MLB games. Obviously, the baseball savant website offers information on total horizontal and vertical movement of pitches, as well as their release point, however, if possible, I’m looking for more specific data about the position of the ball along its path to home plate. I just don’t know if this data even exists or is publicly available. While researching this, I’ve heard a lot about the idea of “scraping” data from the MLB Pitch f/x database but I don’t really know what that means or whether it would even provide me with additional data, that I can’t already get from baseball savant, relevant to what I’m searching for.

Alternatively, I’m looking for websites that display the estimated or actual flight of the pitch, sort of like you see when you watch games through the MLB At Bat app, except from a side view. I know that their is a page under “visuals” on baseball savant where you can see pitch trails for every pitch thrown, but it’s a little difficult to line up the view of the pitch pathway so that you can overlay a graph on top of it, which is what my intention would be. Is there a website other than baseball savant where this data is available?

Thank you very much for any input you can give me.

By the way, if I’ve greatly overestimated the capabilities of technology to track pitch flight or am searching for a database that likely doesn’t exist, I’m sorry, I’m just getting into the world of advanced baseball stats.

Thank you again and have a nice day.",1

"Hi All,

I've been quite stuck on chapter 11 and chapter 12 in Albert and Marchi's *Baseball with R*.

"MS in Data Science student.  Just finished up a final project in which I aimed to optimize stolen base attempts in MLB.  

Data: 2016 pitch-by-pitch data from Sportradar, Player data from Fangraphs, Run expectancy matrix.  

Approaches: Predict (CART, RF, GBM, OCT, OCT-H) then Optimize (Regress &amp; Compare), Predict and Optimize concurrently (OPT)

Results: Best results with Optimal Prescriptive Trees (OPT). Stealing based on this model projects to increase run expectancies by roughly 200 runs over the course of the season, based on out-of-sample performance. We found that the run expectancies DECREASED for the league as a whole as a result of actual stolen base attempts (overconfidence in base stealing abilities).  Stealing with my model projects an increase in run expectancies, again based on out-of-sample data.  200 runs is a pretty sizable inefficiency, and it is just sitting out there for teams to take advantage of.

The analysis is extremely thorough, so I pretty confident in these results.  Would love to discuss further/answer any questions in this thread.  There must be a demand for a model like this, no?  The beauty of OPT is that it is highly interpretable (literally just a simple decision tree), so a manager could actually use it in a game.

"I am trying to determine pitcher similarity scores at the pitch level (i.e. on a pitch-by-pitch basis and not comparing full arsenals). Currently, I am doing this by taking relevant columns (for example, velocity, horz/vert movement, etc.) and doing a simple Euclidean distance after normalization. However, I don't necessarily like this approach because I am currently weighting all columns the same in the distance calculation.

I've recently learned about random forests and it seems like that might be a better way of handling this problem. I don't know much about them, but it appears they can offer weights based on the importance of each feature. Could I use this to give me a list of, for example, how similar each pitch type is to Trevor Bauer's FF by adding up all the features multiplied by the weights? I was thinking about using a random forest classifier, and that would give me the closest pitch type to the input, right? Or would a regressor be better for this problem?

I know there's other things to consider as well, such as pitcher handedness and which pitch types I want to compare, but strictly for a basic comparison, would random forests work?

If random forests aren't suited for this problem, are there alternatives to Euclidean distance that might make more sense?",1

"I asked for some help on this sub, so I figured I'd share the fruits of my labor.

I did a lot of analysis on season to season delta on BB% based on both a players age and how they performed the season prior. I used all data from 2009 to 2019, and restricted the data to seasons that had at least 100 PA. This was based off the assumption that BB% normalizes at 100 PAs, but further investigation suggested that 120 PAs is a better value. Maybe I'll update my analysis in the future, but I think 100 PAs will be sufficient to start.

I adjusted all hitter data to normalize based on the average BB% overall compared to each seasons individual league wide BB% trends.

I looked at the delta for season prior, 2 seasons prior, 3, 4 and 5 seasons prior, and 1 season prior appeared to have the most normal distribution, so I'm sticking with that data. 1 season prior also had the most data, and I think this may be why the data was more normal than the rest.

Age was extremely consistent, with a strong positive correlation (0.14% gained with every year aged on average). R\^2 was 0.976 and clearly linear.

📷

Standard deviation for age was fairly consistent for all ages at around 2.83%, although when graphing the StDev for all ages, the R\^2 was a disappointing 0.111. This data seemed to be somewhat linear, with a very low positive slope, so I am going to maintain faith the average stdev (2.83%) of the ages is good enough to represent all ages.

📷

I adjusted the data for age, and found that based on the season prior, BB% delta had a very strong negative correlation that trended towards a BB% of 7% regardless of if BB% was above or below 7%. R\^2 was 0.997 and clearly linear.

 📷 

Standard deviation for BB% delta from season prior was more promising than age related stdev. When graphing the standard deviations in relation to the previous seasons BB%, there was a positive correlation with a clearly linear trend and an R\^2 value of 0.919.

 📷 

When I combined this two factors into one prediction model, I compared the predicted values to the actual values and created a histogram from the data using 0.1 sigma increments. I used MAE and RMSLE for 1, 2 and 3 sigma to determine fitness of the model.

My use of MAE and RMSLE was determined from primarily these two sources:

"I've been playing around with fWAR for a little research lately and I've had a few questions about how they calculate it that I was hoping someone could shed some light on:

In the batting runs portion, why do they use only the conference for RC and PA instead of the entire league? It doesn't throw the numbers off that much, but it seems strange to me that they would choose to do that when WAR is a league wide stat.

For fielding runs they use UZR value for non-catcher. However when you look at their own library they say to be weary of using UZR to determine how well a defender is due to limited innings in some cases. If you want to compare players with differing games played a position, use UZR/150 -- so why not use that in WAR as well?

I might be nitpicking a bit, but I'm also really curious why these decisions were made.",1
"When querying data with [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search), you can search for data on all pitches thrown or seen by either pitchers or batters, respectively.  You can filter these results by setting a metric range for either  ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" or ""Batter - Times Thru"" but I can't figure out what the latter does.

When searching for pitchers, ie Jacob DeGrom, setting ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" &lt;= 1 returns pitches thrown by Jacob DeGrom against the first 9 batters of every game. 

When searching for batters, ie Aaron Judge, I *thought* setting  ""Batter - Times Thru"" &lt;= 1 would return pitches seen by Aaron Judge the first time he faced a given pitcher, but it also returns pitches seen the second time around against some pitchers. Conversely, setting ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" &lt;= 1, *does* return pitches seen by Aaron Judge the first time he faced a given pitcher, so it would seem ""Pitcher - Times Thru"" controls the number of times through the order, regardless of whether searching for pitchers or batters.

Still, setting ""Batter - Times Thru"" did remove some results, but looking at the data it returns, I couldn't figure out what it filters for.",1

Hundreds of hyperactive people around the country (and a few around the world that I've met too!) of all ages all addicted to the same criminally-underrated baseball sim game as you, of whom you trade with, compete against, and discuss everything baseball with on a daily basis. I don't know where I'd be without it.

"Apologies for flooding this page with questions, but I had another clarification question with regards to some of the math. This one is related to expected wOBA in Chapter 2 of The Book. 

For this chapter they are analyzing player's hot/cold streaks by comparing a player's expected wOBA versus observed wOBA for a certain number of games after a supposed streak. My question is related to how they calculate a player's expected wOBA.

Using the example in the text, to compute the expected wOBA of a group with Barry Bonds, Steve Finley, and A-rod, we do the following. Found on page 59: ""Look up Bonds' wOBA for 2000, 2001, and 2002 combined."" Repeat for Finley and A-rod. ""Finally, we would average all three-players' three-year wOBA weighted by the number of post-streak PA each player has. This number is the expected wOBA for all the players in this particular bucket."" Given they provide the post-streak PA, in the paragraph before as 95, 63, and 89 for Bonds, Finley, and A-rod, this would be the straightforward calculation: (95\*Bonds\_wOBA + 63\*Finley\_wOBA + 89\*Arods\_wOBA)/(95+63+89).

They go on to analyze the 10 hottest streaks in 2003 and they state: Here is a list of the ten players who had the hottest seven-game streak in 2003, along with their three-game post-hot streak wOBA, and their expected (three-year) wOBA. (See Table 16)."" - page 61. My question is how do they calculate the expected wOBA for the individual player. I know it is not a player's three-year wOBA because I have checked and it does not match. For example, take Marcus Giles, the first guy in the table. His expected wOBA after his hot streak was .354. His wOBA from 01-03 was .363 (I used FanGraphs for this). Are they weighting each year's wOBA, by each year's post streak PA in this case?",1

"This is an attempt by me to calculate how valuable a defender is based on inside edge fielding. If you are not familiar with IE Fielding, it divides plays into how likely an average fielder would make that play. There are 6 zones:

&amp;#x200B;

* Routine/Almost Certain: 90-100%+ chance to make
* Likely: 60-90% chance to make
* About Even: 40-60% chance to make
* Unlikely: 10-40% chance to make
* Remote: 1-10% chance to make
* Impossible: 0% chance to make

&amp;#x200B;

Note: these ranges are from the fangraphs post on Inside Edge Fielding ([https://library.fangraphs.com/defense/inside-edge-fielding/](https://library.fangraphs.com/defense/inside-edge-fielding/)). You can see that Routine is not listed, I will get into why I listed Routine as a category later^(\[1\]).

&amp;#x200B;

So while this measures how likely a player is to make all of these plays, there is no cumulative rating for Inside Edge Fielding that I have found. Now, I wanted to make a cumulative rating to use for some analysis of players in Out of the Park Baseball 21, because zone rating just measures how likely a player is to reach a ball and range factor measures the same thing, but with a different method. There is no counting stat that brings into account how often a player makes errors on easy plays in OOTP ^(\[2\]). In order to do this, I use the following formula:

&amp;#x200B;

    (0.01 * BIZ-Rm - (0.99 * (BIZ-R - BIZ-Rm)))
    (0.1 * BIZ-Lm - (0.9 * (BIZ-L - BIZ-Lm)))
    (0.5 * BIZ-Em - (0.5 * (BIZ-E - BIZ-Em)))
    (0.75 * BIZ-Um - (0.25 * (BIZ-U - BIZ-Um)))
    (0.99* BIZ-Zm - (0.01 * (BIZ-Z - BIZ-Zm)))
    (2*BIZ-Im)                                +

&amp;#x200B;

This formula rewards players for making hard plays and punishes players for making errors on easy plays. Not only does this give context behind errors (a player with higher range commits more errors than a low range player because they have more opportunities), but it also punishes lower range players for not making plays an average defender would make.

The weights are fairly arbitrary. For example, the About Even zone has a 50/50 weight, which is in the middle of the range. However, the Likely zone has a weight of .1 for a made play and .9 for an unmade play. I don't know how to determine the proper weights, so I wanted a baseline to start with. I looked at the ranges listed on fangraphs and based it off of those. As I am trying to find a good defender, I want to heavily punish players for not making easier plays, while also rewarding them for making almost impossible plays. At the same time, I don't want to reward players too much for making easy plays and not punish them for missing the harder plays. Almost Certain and Remote are based on the top end (assuming there is no play that is 100%) and bottom end of the zone, 99% and 1%. For Likely, I used the 90% because, again, I want to punish players for making errors on simple plays. For unlikely, because it has such a large range I went with the mid point of 25%. While I think most players should make a lot of 40% plays, I also don't want to punish them too much for missing a 10% play.

Impossible has a straight add 2 without any kind of penalty. Again, you want to reward players for making those nigh impossible plays, and you don't want to punish them for not making a play they didn't have a chance at. The Hardball Times ([https://tht.fangraphs.com/digging-deep-into-inside-edges-fielding-data/](https://tht.fangraphs.com/digging-deep-into-inside-edges-fielding-data/)) pointed out that outfielders will have some plays that are impossible, like gappers that a player has no chance to make cause or ones that fall in just over the infielder's heads, but falls into a zone manned by the outfielder for Inside Edge.

Now, a certain number of people, hopefully most of you, are saying ""But why are you using your bias to weight the plays? That will make the information less reliable!"" I agree. However, I am bad at math and could not determine a better way to determine the proper weighting. And if I just waited until I had perfect or even really solid weighting I would never have started. If anyone has any suggestions on how I could make the formula better I am open to ideas. I'm not married to any of the weights.

Now, because OOTP is a foreign concept to a lot of people, and I assume some people here who play OOTP don't get into Perfect Team much, let's take a look at 2 players to see how the metric works. I'm going to look at the 2019 season for Adalberto Mondesi and Andrelton Simmons^(\[3\]). Both are shortstops. Simmons is considered one of the best shortstops of all time, is certainly the best active shortstop and deserves to at least be in the conversation with players like Ozzie Smith and Omar Vizquel.

Mondesi is definitely a good shortstop, but he is not on the same level as Simmons. Looking at his UZR metrics, he had a double play rating of 1.3, range rating of 3.7 and error rating of 4.1. This was good enough for a UZR/150 of 11.7 - certainly adding value definsively. Part of that is driven by his OOZ - he made plays on 57 plays outside of his zone, about once every other game (he spent a good chunk of the season on the IL and only played 102 games).

BIZ-CR:

* Andrelton Simmons: 17.65
* Adalberto Mondesi: -7.41^(\[4\])

Now there's a couple of things to consider before we continue. The first thing is that you cannot compare across positions. As Inside Edge is based on how an average fielder at the position would field the play, comparing a center fielder to a first baseman is not a good comparison. Another reason you can't compare across positions is due to the second thing to consider: more opportunities equals a higher cumulative rating. This rating is not normalized, although you could normalize it to 150 games in the same manner UZR is normalized.

However, this is an apt comparison. Both players are short stops, and Simmons played 103 games, one more than Mondesi. You can see that Simmons is a much better shortstop than Mondesi. The biggest difference between the two players is the ability for Simmons to convert the unlikely and remote plays. 

For more insight on this, it is helpful to look at Mondesi's 2018 UZR metrics. His range rating was 6.1, which is certainly well above average and comparable to Simmons in 2019. However, in 2018 Mondesi had a -2.1 double play rating and -0.6 error rating. Mondesi is very good at reaching balls with his 80 grade speed. However, outside of the range he is probably an average shortstop.

Why is this number valuable over something like DRS or UZR? The main difference is that these statistics take the run value of the ball into account, while Inside Edge information is run-neutral. As fangraphs states, ""Some fielders are good at making the easy plays but don't have range. Some players have tremendous range but fail to execute easy plays. Inside Edge lets you track that more easily than the high level stats which only show you run values.""

In the scenario I am in, I care about how a player performs on every play, not just plays with higher run values. I care about a diving grab in the outfield with no one on in the first as much as I do when the bases are loaded in the ninth. We all know there is no one metric that is perfect for measuring a player's performance. This is another tool I devised to help me measure something I didn't have a great way to measure. I want to put a player out there who, on average, is going to make the most plays.

**TL;DR: I took the plays made and not made according to inside edge and combined it into 1 number that attempts to show how good a player is at making plays.**

&amp;#x200B;

\[1\] The Certain/Almost certain field in OOTP is referred to as Routine. It uses R for routine plays and Z for remote plays.

\[2\] I need counting stats because I need to combine various simulations with the same player under 1 player. In tournaments, players get 4-35 games to perform. That is not enough to get a large sample size. However, simulating a bunch of tournaments and combining all copies of the player to develop a larger sample gives a much more accurate depiction of a player's performance.

\[3\] Fangraphs does not have IE Fielding for 2020, but it does have other defensive metrics. Fangraphs also does not provide the opportunities and made plays, just a percentage and a number. I could not determine whether that was the opportunities or made plays, so I am working as though that's the made plays. For one it makes more sense to me to display the number of plays made than opportunities. If I am wrong, while the actual numbers will change, the values will have a similar spread.

\[4\] Most players in my experience have ratings below 0. I think players are punished too hard for not making plays, but I am not sure how to adjust it. This is a great example of how the formula is far from perfect, or even complete.",1

All the data we compute is stored in a MySQL database and the code is shared  publicly on GitHub([https://github.com/andres-alvarado/beisbol-analitica](https://github.com/andres-alvarado/beisbol-analitica)). It also contains play by play, pitch by pitch data, etc.

"Hi All,
I’ve developed a simulation model that produces estimates for expected runs and win probability by simulating every plate appearance left in the game, using a basic line of statistics for each player (PA’s, singles, doubles, walks, HRs etc). From this, you can also get a great deal of other simulation metrics and cool analysis.
My question is how would you best test this model to identify its accuracy?
Also, I would be interested to hear what use applications you might have for such a tool.",1
"So, for the past 3-4 years I’ve been involved in professional baseball in some capacity - most recently being an affiliate based data analyst. I then moved on from working with teams due to the rigorous travel and the poor compensation compared to market value. I found another job in sport technology - but it relied on a minor league season happening and it was cancelled, so I lost my job. I can’t see even being in the industry again for at least 3 years given teams won’t be hiring and direct partners like TrackMan/Rapsodo/etc likely are taking a huge hit as well

I know this isn’t the best subreddit to post this. This is a data-driven community with a passion for baseball - so I figured try to see if anyone had ideas. I worked incredibly hard to build a strong resume in professional sports, am proud of my work and have tons of references - and it crushes me to leave sports. I guess I’m just trying to see if people know of sports adjacent technology/data/fitness companies that are out there. Maybe I can’t work directly in baseball, but I have a passion for human performance through technology (think FitBit) - and am having trouble even knowing where to start.

My skill set is entry level. I just began a Master’s in CompSci. I’m great at communicating technology and working with players. But I am spending time honing my technical skills. So, TLDR, I’m just wondering if anyone may have any ideas. Baseball is really all I ever knew, and the idea of totally leaving crushes me, so I’m just looking for anything sort of in the field, or at least in fitness/wellness technology where I could do anything.",1

I found that the average strike/ball ratio is **slightly lower when the shift is on**, and the difference is statistically significant, but does this make sense? Intuitively, my explanation is that teams pitch batters to roll over into the shift, so pitchers try harder to hit their spots instead of just throwing strikes.

"In this article, we motivate the SEAM (synthetic estimated average matchup) method for describing batter versus pitcher matchups, both numerically and visually. We provide a [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com) that is available at

[https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/app/](https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/app/).

This app allows users to visualize synthetic spray chart distributions (batted-ball distributions) for any batter-pitcher matchup that has occurred or could have occurred in the last five years, the years that [Statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) data exists. These synthetic spray charts are visualized over an image of a representative baseball field so that the batted ball distribution is displayed to give proper context. Our app also reports performance metrics that are calculated directly from the displayed synthetic spray chart distribution. The expected number of singles, doubles, triples, home runs are reported. The expected batting average on balls in play (xBABIP) and the expected bases on contact (xBsCON) are also reported. These matchup dependent metrics allow for any user to assess the expected performance of batters and pitchers when they face each other.

The SEAM method is based on estimating a spray chart distribution that describes the distribution of batted balls produced when a particular batter faces a particular pitcher. Informally, these spray chart distributions are 2-dimensional contours that overlay spray charts. We construct these spray chart distributions for batter-pitcher matchups where separate batter spray chart distributions are constructed for each of the pitches that the pitcher throws. Rich pitch characteristic information is used to supplement labelled pitch type data since the velocity, trajectory, movement characteristics, and release points of a pitch exhibit large variation across pitchers. The reported spray chart distribution for the batter pitcher matchup is the aggregation of the spray chart distributions for each pitch that the pitcher throws. The aggregation is with respect to the percentage that the pitcher throws each pitch.

One concern with this approach is the potential sparsity of batter-pitcher matchup data. We alleviate this concern with the development of synthetic batters and pitchers with similar characteristics as the batter and pitcher under study. Our synthetic player creation methodology is inspired by the notion of similarity scores like those motivating [PECOTA](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/pecota-projections/) and [Bill James's work](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/similarity.shtml). However, unlike the similarity scores presented in the past, we construct similarity scores using a nearest neighbor approach that is based on the underlying batter and pitcher characteristics of the players under study instead of observed statistics. For pitcher comparisons, pitchers are aggregated on a season and pitch type basis. The variables considered are: velocity, spin rate, horizontal break, horizontal release angle, horizontal release point, vertical break, vertical release angle, vertical release point, and extension. Averages of these variables are taken across each pitcher-pitch type combination. To be eligible for comparison, a pitcher must share at least \[n\_{pitch types}/2\] pitches with the pitcher under study, where n\_{pitch types} is the number of pitch types thrown by the pitcher under study, and \[\] is the [ceiling function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions). For batter comparisons, batters are aggregated on a season, handedness, and pitch type basis. The variables considered are: exit velocity, launch angle, pull%, middle%, and oppo%. Averages of these variables are taken across each batter-pitch type combination. These player characteristics are obtained from Statcast and is scraped using functionality in the [baseballr](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) R package. These characteristics reflect the underlying talent and tendencies of players.

For each batter-pitcher matchup we estimate three spray chart densities, the first is the natural spray chart density corresponding to the players under study, the second is the spray chart of the synthetic pitcher versus the original batter, and the third is the spray chart of the original pitcher versus the synthetic batter. We report a synthetic spray chart density which is a weighted average of these spray chart densities. The weights are chosen with the aim of minimizing estimation uncertainty in the form of [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error).

"Hi all, 

I'm interested in looking at how pitching stats change in relation to how many times they have faced the lineup. For example, how ERA or OBA changes from the first time through the lineup, to the second time and etc.. 

I have data for each batting event outcome by pitcher (hit, out, walk, etc.) pulled from statcast, so it includes variables such as game date/ID and opponent. 

I am only interested in collecting league-wide/aggregate data, so no need to partition by team or player (although I may wish to do this eventually.)

My thought process (to find OBA for example) is to do something like, for each game:

* Track each pitcher tracking how many batters they face. 
* For the first 9 batters, compute the # of hits and at-bats, and add them to separate total counters that will track the first time through the order. 
* Repeat the same process for the 10-18th, 19th-27th batters faced, keeping respective total counters.
* Then use the total aggregated values to calculate the average OBA for each group. 

This seems rather convoluted, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a better method to make this kind of calculation that I could read up on.

"Long story short I'm looking to start a project, where I redraft each MLB draft starting in the year 1960, but this time GMs have access to se a full player's career before making a decision. (ex. in 2004 the  Verlander would go 1st overall while Matt Bush the 1st overall pick IRL wouldn't be drafted anywhere close to the 1st round). WAR is the biggest stat/factor in deciding who to take.

There's a few different strategies, taking the player with the most WAR, but that might be misleading (for example Andy Pettitte has more career WAR than Sandy Koufax but only because he pitched for 6 more years). 

When determining JAWS they use a player's 7 best seasons, but some players don't pitch effectively for 7 seasons (ex. Matt Harvey who only pitched for 3 good years and struggled mightily since or Sonny Gray who's been good one year, bad the next, but good the year after)

"My COVID project was an intro to data science (mainly coding in R), and I did spend a lot of time watching baseball this season. Might as well have some fun with it. But, I've run into a snag.

I was kicking around the idea of looking at the pitch before or after a specific event. For example, after a swinging strike, does the batter's Z-swing or O-swing change? 

It seems like a simple enough search on Baseball Savant, as it's quite easy to set a search for swinging third strike pitches. From there, you'd just look at the next pitch after each of them. Export to a CSV and we're off and running.

Except, even with all the variables you get for each pitch, there's isn't a ""pitch number"" or some other identifier. So, I can't look by just incrementing the identifying value and looking at those. 

Is there a way to get a sample of pitches that happened just before or after a specific event, rather than the event's pitch itself, either on Baseball Savant or some other site?",1
"Hey everyone,

Heres the second post on a series I’m going to be writing on learning Python with baseball. I explain how we can classify pitch types based off of velocities, accelerations, and spin rates.

Machine learning can be a daunting topic, but my goal is to break it down in a way that anyone can understand the basics no matter your coding experience. 

Specifically, I go in depth into what a decision tree is and how it can be a powerful tool in classifying pitch types in the MLB. We can even train and test our model on any pitcher you are interested in (I try Gerrit Cole and Yu Darvish) and get accuracies above 90 percent!

I’ll be posting blog posts on how to use Python to do baseball analysis every week and sending out an email when they’re up so you guys can follow along.

I have a good amount of experience with the good and bad sides of the industry, and I wanted to share — based on my experience — what you should look for in a legitimate analytics writing position and what you should avoid, to help people know what is worth their time.

If you're interested in writing for any other position — not just analytics — I think these rules may apply too. Sports analytics aren't the only field with these issues.

Here are what you should look for in analytics writing positions:

# 1. Fair Payment

## What to avoid

I cannot stress enough how important it is that you ensure that you get paid. I have seen a variety of positions thrown up on this and other subreddits offering the following as compensation for writing or social media work:

* Experience
* Exposure
* A resume builder
* Access to professional editors
* A percentage share of advertising revenues
* Unconventional payment structures

All of these have sincere issues as far as compensation, and they are red flags that you should look elsewhere. I will explain why.

### Experience:

When someone offers you the ability to write articles ""for experience"", they are usually, at best, only offering you a prompt for your articles *and nothing else*. The experience of writing for someone else's website is little different than if you were writing for yourself on your own personal blog. The only difference is that you are offering up your labor for someone else to make money off of. Your experience writing for another website is just as valuable as blogging for yourself, and down the road, people will treat those experiences almost identically.

I will also note that if you work is good enough to appear on a website, it is good enough for you to be paid for it, regardless of how many weeks, months, or years you have spent writing. When you write an article for a website, you are a businessman selling your product, and you are a bad businessman if you are giving away your product for free.

### Exposure

When someone offers you exposure instead of money to write for them, it is important to know that their exposure is effectively worthless. A good rule of thumb is this: if a website does not generate enough clicks to pay you, then it does not generate enough exposure to make it worth your while. When a website claims the former, the latter follows, unless the owners of the website are bizarrely hellbent on sponging up all the revenue for themselves.

Exposure is something you can generate on your own. You will generate 10x more exposure by frequently pitching yourself to legitimate websites, networking, and promoting your own blog than by simply writing for a content mill. You do not need someone to give it to you, you can go out and get it yourself.

### A resume builder

Again, this is something you can do on your own. Writing samples are everything, but whether or not your samples are hosted on your own website or on another are inconsequential. In general, if a website is reputable enough to boost your resume, it is reputable enough to pay you fairly. 

### Access to professional editors

There is something truly strange about a website that prioritizes editors over writers, who are ultimately responsible for the words that get printed on the site. This is not to speak down to the position of editor (having been an editor myself and having worked for several great, talented editors), rather it is to say that such a perk is often talked up much more than it is. If you are concerned about having an editor, I would suggest you work on your own editorial skills working on your own pieces. These will come in handy down the line and help your personal development.

### A percentage of advertising revenues

This is something of a gray area. I have worked for a site that offered a rate of $5 for every 1,000 clicks my article got, but this was on top of a $45 base payment per article and they were very transparent about the performance of my work. I have also worked for a site that offered me $1 for every 1,000 clicks, with no base pay — which turned out to be just a few cents after I discovered how poorly the website actually performed in terms of clicks.

This might be a case by case basis, and I would advise that if someone offers you a position with this as your primary means of compensation, to ask them how well an average article performs in terms of total earnings. If they tell you what the most was they ever made for an article, press on them and ask them for the average figure. Then, it's up to you — but I highly recommend positions that offer a base rate per article or per word.

### Unconventional Payment Structures

I have seen some sites offer some truly unusual forms of compensation and, at times, even have the audacity to ask the *writers to pay the website for the privilege of publishing the article*. Unless you work for a PR agency, this is not the norm. Convoluted structures such as ""you write for us for free for three months and then we start paying you a percentage of ad revenue"" are almost certain to leave you underpaid.

## What to look for

In general, as a freelancer, you should be looking for positions that offer a fair amount for the writing you do. How much your time is worth might be up to you, but in general, when I was first starting out, I considered about 1 hour of work to be worth about $8 (approximately the federal minimum wage), and I tended to avoid opportunities that offered less than $10 per article — because it would generally take me longer than an hour to write a 600-800 word piece. The pay scales may vary from outlet to outlet, but in general, you should think long and hard about how much work a website asks you to do versus how much they pay you for.

If you find yourself unable to find a website that will pay fairly for your work, two things:

* *Keep trying*. Keep pitching yourself, keep in contact with editors, network, etc. One of the first places I got paid fairly for, it took me several tries before one of my pitches got accepted. Keep pitching — it's good practice for future pitches, and it shows the type of persistence that will make editors want to bring you on or contact you for articles in the future.

* *In the meantime, write for yourself*. When you have a good article idea and you can't pitch it anywhere, write it yourself and post it on a blog. At a bare minimum, you have a sample you can be proud of and submit to other websites. Don't let someone else take your article and publish it for you for free — like I said, you're a businessman, and it's bad business to give away your product for free.

The holy grail of analytics writing is a full-time writing position (hard to come by in our current COVID-19 economy). If by some miracle you chance upon something like this — something I was never able to, hence the career change — then remember to value yourself fairly (though it's a lot more difficult for outlets to skirt underpayment laws with positions like these, so you are almost certainly fine — pat yourself on the back, you made it!).

# 2. Outlet Size and Culture

## What to avoid

In general, the idea of what constitutes a ""reputable"" outlet is up to your discretion. However, there are several red flags you can look out for in terms of outlets to avoid, avoiding them because they might scam you, steal your work, or are not worth your time.

* *The outlet has a very small social media presence and is run by people you're not familiar with.* In general, if there's very little history on an outlet and it doesn't seem to have a large social media presence, unless it has some fairly prominent name backing it, it might not be 100% legitimate.

* *The outlet has a poor reputation*. Websites affiliated with a particular brand named after a chair you might find at a pub plus the word sports do not have a great reputation in terms of editorial content, let alone the way they represent themselves to the general public, and they're not alone. Do some background work on the people who run the website, the people who write for the website, and the quality of the work they churn out. It will never hurt you to do some research — then again, I probably don't have to tell /r/Sabermetrics that.

* *The outlet frequently engages in spam practices to share their articles*. One of the scummy places I worked for had a practice of writing articles, then submitting their article to every single reddit community where it could be applicable. This strategy is fairly common but also highly volatile — their domain was shadowbanned from reddit and what little revenue they got from spam vanished overnight. If an outlet cannot rely on organic engagement to share their pieces and generate revenue, then their revenue streams — and your means of getting paid — are shaky at best.

All of this advice is, obviously, on a case-by-case basis. I advise you to exercise your best judgement when it comes to evaluating outlets. But in general, you should think — do I want to write here and work with these people?

## What to look for

When I was looking for places to write for, a couple things stood out to me as positives, and I recommend you look for them too.

* *Direct and up-front communication*. Of all of the places I worked for that I had the best experience with, all of them were very direct and up front — about what types of pitches they were looking for, how frequently  they were looking for pitches, and how much I would be paid. If a place isn't afraid to shy away from their practices, you can have some degree of confidence that they're follow through on them.
* *Affiliated with reputable outlets or writers*. Thanks to public pressure, it has been far more difficult for outlets like Sports Illustrated and SBNation to offer [pennies on the dollar or less to writers](https://web.archive.org/web/20200611052423/https://deadspin.com/how-sb-nation-profits-off-an-army-of-exploited-workers-1797653841). Blogs affiliated with larger, national outlets can be a double edged sword, but you can usually find out good information about working for these places by virtue of their prominence. You can also feel more confident if a website already has other prominent writers working for it, or people that you know and trust.
* *Solid social media presence*. This can be subverted with fake accounts or astroturfed networks — I worked for a place that created hundreds of twitter accounts to promote the content we created for each team the content was relevant to and had them all follow each other so they looked more popular than the other — but if there is consistent, organic social media engagement with a website's posts, that's a good sign that they're legitimate. If a website has *no* social media presence, run the opposite direction.

# 3. Application Process

A lot of what I have told you to look out for will pop up during the application process, either organically or you can ask questions about it. There are some other important things you should look out for with regards to applying to work for websites.

## What to avoid

* A common scam for disreputable sites is to ask writers to write an article as a part of the application process on a topic given by the hiring editor. When the article is finished and submitted, the writer is ghosted and the editor posts the piece under their or another name on their site, getting free labor. Reputable websites should be and will be happy to evaluate you on the basis of your samples, not on a contrived writing exercise.

* Asking you to do arbitrary behind the scenes things, like recruiting writers for the website or editing other pieces for free. I will caution you to exercise your best judgement, but in general, if you are going to do something for a website, you shouldn't do it for free. Remember, you're a businessman!

# Bonus — How to Pitch Yourself

Understanding that with the sports world at a standstill, getting paid to write about sports is even more challenging than it is right now, I want to really quickly guide you through the process of getting paid, either as a freelancer or contributor, to write analytics articles for outlets.

Before pitching yourself, I would recommend making sure you have the following:

* *A portfolio of 8-10 published pieces*. These can be all of the articles you have ever written or they can be a handful out of hundreds. Point being that these articles should represent your best work. Ideally, your articles will span the topics you feel comfortable writing about and showcase a variety of tone and analytical techniques. You should edit them as you see fit to make the best impression. If you have previously written for multiple outlets, you may be inclined to show off the variety of outlets you've written for in the past in your portfolio, but my advice is to prioritize the quality of your writing over demonstrating a variety of outlets — it's also fine if every single piece is from your personal blog. I have personally used https://www.journoportfolio.com/ in the past but other services are out there as well.

* At least three good pitches. A pitch is a short, ~100 word blurb about an article that you want to write. Succinctly, it will explain what the idea of the article is and why it's important. I think it's always a good idea to have at least three at any given time — when I was offered a contributor position, that was how many they asked me for.

* If you're applying for an advertised contributor or full-time position, I would have a resume and references prepared as well.

If someone advertises a contributor or full-time position, then apply via whichever method they ask — usually an online form or through email. If applying via email, be sure to include a link to your portfolio, even if they don't explicitly ask for it — they want to see it and will ask for it eventually if they don't upfront.

If someone is actively looking for pitches, then send them an email. Briefly introduce yourself, link to your portfolio and then pitch them on an article that you want to write. Be polite, formal, and make sure to say something like ""Let me know if you'd be interested in something like this."" at the end of the email.

If you are emailing someone who isn't explicitly looking for pitches, send them a quick introductory email and ask if they are accepting pitches while expressing your interest in writing for their outlet. Feel free to say something like ""I have an idea for an article that I think would be a good fit for this site and was hoping to run it by you"". If they follow up, send them a pitch email like I described above.

Above all, be courteous and professional. Keep in mind that if you pitch an article to an outlet and they ask for the article but do not want to pay for it, you can always politely walk away and pitch it elsewhere.

#Conclusion/tl;dr

I understand that the above is a sheer wall of text, so if you don't feel like reading the entire thing, here are a few quick takeaways for you.

* If a website asks you to write for free, you are giving them free labor at little benefit to yourself. You undercut the value of your own labor and the labor of others by writing for someone else for free. In these circumstances, it is universally better to write for yourself on your own blog instead, and I highly recommend and encourage it.

* If you want to write for an outlet, make sure that you do a little research beforehand. If you really want to know what writing for an outlet is like, email some current or former writers — especially former writers, who will feel less of an obligation to shy away from what might be bad about writing there. You'll get honest opinions.

* Get clear, up-front communication from your editors. You'll both be happy.

I ended up accurately predicting 56.77% of the 2018 &amp; 2019 season, and 58.83% of the 2019 season alone.

"
I’m currently a sophomore in college who has gotten the opportunity to work as a undergrad data analyst for a baseball sports analytics group on campus. The group works with the university baseball team to do two main tasks:

- use the teams data services to create scouting reports for upcoming matchups

- use the baseballr package to scrape pitch data from NCAA.com

- an independent project that could be useful for the team (I’d have to run it by the professors and manager)

Pretty much I know nothing about baseball, all the other sports analytics projects I did were about basketball and football. I used a lot of machine learning methods in those projects. I would like to do an independent project with some applications of supervised machine learning to baseball, but due to my lack of domain knowledge I don’t know what is even useful to  managers/teams. 

If anyone here who is an avid baseball fan, could someone give me some examples of metrics/situations that could be useful if there was a way to use historical data for predictive analytics? If you were a manager where would you want to see analytics used or machine learning to extract insights/predict outcomes? I’m open to ideas/suggestions

For the time being I’m going to work on scouting reports to gain some more knowledge about the sport myself, learn more about the different metrics to eventually maybe find an opportunity myself as well. But as I said I’m open to inspiration from you all.",1

"Hi everyone,

I've been developing a machine learning based pitch evaluation technique, the details of which can be found in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jm9v3m/pitchingbot_using_machine_learning_to_understand/)

The idea is to predict the value of a pitch by only using its characteristics and contextual information, with no specific information on who the pitcher and the batter are.

I've been updating this model and it now can produce probabilities for specific outcomes, as well as a run value for each pitch.

Here are some tools to explore the results which could be of interest to some and I'd be grateful for any feedback

* [Create-your-own-pitch](https://mlpitchquality.shinyapps.io/pitch_tester/): Want to know the expected results for a Gerrit Cole fastball at the top of the zone? The swinging strike rate of a Jacob deGrom slider on the outside corner in an 0-2 count? The results for any pitch in any situation thrown over any part of the plate? You can do that in this web app.

* [Batter Perfomance](https://mlpitchquality.shinyapps.io/batter_app/): By comparing actual results to expected results from the model, we can look at batter performance while controlling for pitching quality on an individual pitch basis.

* [Pitcher Grades](https://mlpitchquality.shinyapps.io/pitcher_app/) I like to think of my model as a robot scout, I've grouped its results and converted them to the 20-80 scouting scale. Here you can see how pitchers were graded based on the quality of their pitches in the 2020 season.

"Specifically, I'm trying to understand Cody Bellinger's 2019. His Fangraphs page is [here](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/cody-bellinger/15998/stats?position=1B/OF) for reference. His 2019 ""Def"" is 3.4.

I know that Fangraphs uses UZR in their calculations so here is how I *think* that his ""Def"" would be calculated. He played 3 positions so it should be the sum of his UZR at each position with each position's defensive adjustment (prorated for the amount of time he played at each position). 

Per Fangraphs, a full season is 1,214 defensive innings. So I took the following to calculate his Def, but came up with a total Def of 2.2 instead of 3.4 as expected, can anyone tell me what I'm missing when trying to calculate this value? Thanks:

As I understand it, MLB is requiring sportsbooks to use official datasources and MLB has partnered with SportsRadar to be the (only?) provider of data to the sportsbooks (and media companies).

This can be good in some ways as MLBAM does not have in their mission to support the ETL needs of publishers, broadcasters, and sportsbooks, let alone individual consumers of the data.

However, I have tried to contact, so far, two feeds providers and neither is very enthusiastic in dealing with a small, paying customer. I tried SportsRadar and Don Best so far.

Does anyone have any insight into this changing landscape? 

* PitchFX is being replaced by the newer, better Statcast.
* MLB agreement with PitchFX ""owner"" SportsMEDIA Technology Corp (SMT) expires 12/31/2019.
* PitchFX data has remained in freely obtainable XML feeds.
* MLBAM made Statcast data available via API to the public temporarily
* The MLBAM API is now locked down.

My personal opinion is that this might be a good time to build some scrapers to collect the data. Unfortunately, that's a very turbulent form of data collection, and it would require a lot of redundancy so that when one website (data source) changes their site, you have another scraper still working.

It can be hard enough to react to small changes in a clean data source over time, but having to do things like this will make it infinitely more labor intensive. I'd gladly pay for the data, but the official providers don't want small customers.

The prediction categories I'm looking at using are:  
  
-The previous pitch types and their locations from the given plate appearance (if applicable)   
-The count   
-Batter handedness  
-The base state  
-The number of outs in the innings  
-Pitch count  
-Batter ISO (how much of a power hitter is the batter)  
  
However, for previous pitch types and locations, the data might be null (i.e. the first pitch of a plate appearance). One potential solution is to go back and just use pitches from the previous plate appearance, however setting up specific pitches doesn't carry from one batter to another which removes part of the goal of this project.

"I attempted to create a statistic that measures which batters were most affected by defensive shifts. Basically the idea was, for every ball hit into play for an out against a shift, take the exit velocity, launch angle, and the hit coordinates, and find the league-average batting average for similarly hit balls (in my code, +/- 10% for each stat). If the league-average BA on those similarly hit balls was over 0.295 (this was the league-average BABIP in 2018), then I counted that as a hit lost to a defensive shift.

I posted this in r/Cricket but didn't get a lot of love so I'd be interested to see if there is anyone in this group who has used sabermetrics in cricket or can see a relevant crossover?

This season I offered the captain of my Last Man Stands (LMS) T20 cricket league side some statistical analysis to influence player selections and predict/improve our results.

Our Team is very much in an amateur league but we all take it very seriously and play to win. We have a squad of about 15 players (depending on availability vying for 8 spots each match).

The Team has previously been ranked in top 25 in the world (there are over 5,000 teams globally) and played in the national championships.

Last season wasn't our best and our ranking slipped back to almost 300 in the world.

In our first two matches I successfully predicted the results (1 win, 1 loss) and whether we would obtain a bonus point or not. Based on team rankings, Head to Head results and overall win percentage.

While I currently do this for my own enjoyment and the good of our team, I wonder if their might be a business/career opportunity doing this. LMS records a wealth of data and its easy to export and manipulate for any team.

Attached is a quadrant analysis of our batsmen (X axis = average, Y = strike rate, size = number of innings). I am point ""D"". I have done similar analysis for our bowling and all rounders.

"Last season I wrote a simple data scraping program to grab pitchf/x data from [https://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/](https://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/) for a side project. Returning to the project this season but a few things have changed. Up until last year all data such as horizontal and vertical break, spin rate, location, pitch type, outcome, etc. where all easily available in xml. This year, it seems that specifically spin rate and axis are completely gone. I'm aware MLB is trying to switch over to Statcast API [http://statsapi.mlb.com/](http://statsapi.mlb.com/), however I have a few questions.

1. How do you get an API key? [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/9jd3l3/the_mlb_api_doc_is_live_again/e6t5p65?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) seems to indicate you can't get a public key. Do you have to be affiliated with a team or something?
2. Even if you get an API key, can you get pitch-by-pitch data that includes spin rate and axis? I've seen a [few](https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame) [Python](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) [APIs](https://github.com/bradleyhurley/PyBall) that can pull a few things like games and individual leaderboards, but none of them even suggest that if I could get an API key, I'd be able to access the data I want.
3. Is there a better place to go? I know the data is still out there somewhere because [Brooks Baseball](http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/pfx.php) still has pitch data that includes spin axis and rate for 2019. However querying isn't very clean and even if you get all the way to the [expanded data](http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/tabdel_expanded.php?pitchSel=605280&amp;game=gid_2019_05_09_pitmlb_slnmlb_1/&amp;s_type=4&amp;h_size=700&amp;v_size=500), there isn't spin rate, only spin axis. I've seen [https://www.mysportsfeeds.com](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) pop up a few times but again, their documentation doesn't seem to suggest I can get pitch information. Even [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/trevor-bauer-545333?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), which has a deal with Statcast and has a very comprehensive search, only has spin rate, not axis.
4. Although it seems unlikely, is it possible the data returns to gd2? In past seasons some sites like Baseball-Reference have trouble at the beginning of the season but correct a few weeks in. At this point I can move forwards on my project without spin rate or axis, but if gd2 is going to disappear, I'd prefer to be up to date on current trends.

"Hi.  This is my first time posting here in Sabremetrics -- I only just realized that I perhaps will find a more intelligent and productive interactions on here versus on /r/DFSports.   Allow me to explain the project i've been working on for most of the season.

&amp;#x200B;

With the goal in mind of making some money by applying math and statistics to daily fantasy baseball, I initially attempted to use machine learning techniques to try predict player's fantasy performance.  After a month or two of this, I threw my hands up in the air and decided to scrap the project.  This is when I happened to meander onto some Sabremetrics blogs, and I heard about using Markov chains to simulate baseball.  Using this along with Bill James' Log5 equation, I ended up creating a pretty damn functional markov-chain based simulator that pulls player data to simulate each day's slate.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically for a given slate of games, I tell my code to generate between 1-2 million lineups, then whittle those down to just those that satisfy the salary requirement for lineups on the DFS site, then I run between 2000-10000 simulations of the slate of games.  After each simulation it calculates how many fantasy points each lineup would have produced, and keep a record tally to look back on later.  Using this, I make (mostly) good wagers on Daily Fantasy Sports sites.

&amp;#x200B;

So why am I posting this?  Well, as we all know, the season is rapidly coming to a close (regular season, at least), and so I am pondering what to do in the off-season while I wait April to come.  I've been thinking: there are a ton of questions I have, and ideas I think might make my codebase work better.  Honestly though, what I really need is someone to bounce ideas off of -- or even to critique my process, to give me a better idea of which way to go.  Ideally I was thinking, someone with a background in Sabremetrics would be preferable to someone with a background in Daily Fantasy Sports, though if anyone out there is both and would care to spend time shootin the shit with me, please let me know.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone who would be interested in helping me out?  Or even, come next year, partnering with me to bring a fresh set of eyes to the codebase?  For the partnership thing, you would need to be familiar with Python.  For anyone who is curious or cares to answer some of my more specific math/sabremetrics/baseball philosophical questions, either msg me or answer here.

1) My attempt to implement park factors into my code seems to have caused a large overinflation of runs scored for various games.  What I did was take the log5 equation and calculated it as (POhitter x PObatter)/POpark, where the PO = Probability/(1-Probability).  What I used for the Probability park factors was to take as much data from 2010 - present for each ballpark, split into four categories:  Left handed hitters @ home,  right handed hitters @ home, left handed hitters @ road, right handed hitters @ road.  

Was this not a good route to go?  Most parks each category would have &gt; 10000 PA worth of data, but some of the newest or recently changed parks it only was \~3000-5000 PA.  Do these splits even make sense, given that those road PA are likely heavily represented by a team's four divisional opponents (meaning for home games against non-divisional opponents, the probability slates may be bad representations?) . 

If this isn't a good way to do it, what kinda approach would you take?

&amp;#x200B;

2) I keep changing the numbers/logic system that tells the code when to stop using the starting pitcher's probability slate, and switch over to the team's collective bullpen probability slate.  If you were to describe a situation to a computer as to when to predict starting pitchers would get pulled (in terms of total runs, runs that inning, bases occupied/outs situation, whatever you want), what set of rules would you use?

BTW, it assumes the initial factors of the other parks are all identical, or have the same number of games with N-1 teams (N=30).

However, it's slighty off because a mlb team have more games in the same division. This was already pointed out in other posts such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/4kjlw9/are_park_factors_real/)

"Hey, this is my first post on this sabermetics subreddits. I am so interested in sabermetics, but do not have friends to think about it together. Here I present the topic I am obssessed recently and want to discuss together. 

FIP could be one of most famous pitching stats in 10 years. So intuitive and not too hard to calculate. 

FIP formula has a constant term about 3.2 (varying up to the league ERA).

If I remember correctly, the constant comes from the bip and was suggested to be a fixed number because our understanding to batted ball was still unclear. 

Statcast now provides many good informations of the batted balls. Thus, we would want to really fielding independent pitching stats finally by using xwOBAcon or some other statcast stats else. I used xwOBAcon and rescaled the constant term to league ERA. You can see the formula at a python file in the Github repo. I temporarily named it nFIP in my project files. 

HR is also dependent on the environments such as the stadium, weathers, so we want to use barrels instead of HR as the represtative of the well-crushed hit. I named it xnFIP in my project files. 

I also want to discuss if rescaling FIP to ERA makes sense. Why not RA? I want to call it rFIP here, and made derivatives too.

I opened [the Github repo](https://github.com/physhik/baseball_lab
) for this project and uploaed Python files, ipython notebooks for practice.

It doesn't make sense to be ""conservative"" about AB projections. PECOTA doesn't try to project injuries (I believe), so ABs are based on platoons and lineup construction. For starting players, ABs simply don't jump around year to year.

"I have recently [published a paper](https://chance.amstat.org/2020/02/nostalgia-metrics/) which finds that popular opinion, media opinion, and baseball statistics (WAR in particular) have all over represented the greatness of baseball players who started their career before baseball was integrated.

The core argument is simple: There are too few eligible MLB players who started their career before baseball was integrated to support the abundance of so many of these players in greatest all-time lists. This finding holds even when increases to interest in other sports are taken into account.

I have also made an app that allows for you the analysts to play around with the eligible MLB populations, [here it is](https://deck13.shinyapps.io/challenging_baseball_nostalgia/). Note that the default choices for the slider bars are meant to be conservative. Some rationale for the default choices come from Gallup polling data, changing salaries, changing media exposure, and many articles about baseball interest abroad. I recommend doing some research before going nuts with the sliders, but you are of course free to do whatever you want.

Shortcomings and discussion points: 1) I did not account for the effect that wars, salary, and media exposure have on pursuing a career in the MLB. I conjecture that a proper account of such effects would strengthen the conclusions of the original analysis, but I cannot say that with certainty. 2) This analysis does not have the ability to definitively say which old time players are overrated and which are true all-time era-invariant great players. 3) Ted Williams and Stan Musial played well after baseball was integrated. That being said, I heavily recommend reading [this SABR article](https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/integration-1947-1986) on the rate of integration before jumping to any conclusions.

"Hi all,

I am new to Sabermetrics, but I am not new to data analysis or baseball.

My two primary goals with the code I have written and made available on Github are:

* to make the Retrosheet data easier to analyze
* to allow for repeatable research

Repeatable research means to make publicly available the scripts which download, process and analyze the data so that anyone can verify the results.  I started by computing the Park Factor for all teams for several years and found that Fangraphs and ESPN both made the same mistake for Fenway Park in 2019, namely that they included the runs the Red Sox and Yankees scored in London as if they were runs scored in Fenway Park.  That is, the Park Factors published by Fangraphs and ESPN are too high for Fenway Park in 2019.

The scripts also automatically parse the Retrosheet data using the cwevent, cwdaily and cwgame parsers.  That output is then collected into ""tidy"" CSV files and an optional script is provided which loads the data into Postgres tables.

I also created Jupyter Notebooks to use the Retrosheet data to:

* compute the Park Factor for each team's home park and compare with web scraped data from Fangraphs
* compute the game-weighted average Park Factor on the road for each team
* compute linear weights using linear regression (similar to the first step in computing wOBA) using play-by-play data aggregated to the half-inning level

I've become interested in a little side project, and it's led me here. I read [this article](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/3/1181/2590011) for a college course I'm in, and as an avid baseball fan I was fascinated by the potential implications of these results.

There's a lot already out there about umpires' making errant strike calls, but I'd like to do a bit of a deeper dive here and see precisely how the umps' propensity to fall prey to the gambler's fallacy can influence at bats (and thus games) and make a Youtube video about it. Hopefully people would find it entertaining and learn a bit about the gambler's fallacy and how it might impact their own lives.

1. The previous pitch was called a strike
2. The pitch in question is called a ball, even though it is a strike 

From there, I would use other data (any ideas on where to find this would be helpful) to examine if an RBI (or multiple RBIs) happened *after* the missed strikeout call. From there, I'd check out what happened in the rest of the game and see if it made a difference as to its outcome.

"Hello,  


I'm a little confused about sample size and stabilization and I was wondering if someone could point out what I'm missing, if anything. Let's use strikeout-rate as an example.  


So, as far as I can tell, strikeout rate is measuring a binomial distribution, right? In any plate appearance, a player either strikes out or he doesn't. A typical strikeout-rate is like 20%, right?  


So, fangraphs has the stabilization point for strike-out rate at 60 ab. 

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://library.fangraphs.com/principles/sample-size/](https://library.fangraphs.com/principles/sample-size/) 

&amp;#x200B;

But if this is a binomial distribution, and we look at a confidence interval around, say, 60 attempts with 12 strikouts, we see this really huge confidence interval. That strikeout rate would be 20%, but the 95% confidence interval would be 10.7% - 32.3%, a frankly huge interval.

 [https://statpages.info/confint.html](https://statpages.info/confint.html)  (plug in 12 for numerator and 60 for denominator)

The metric would be to measure every pitch that a batter saw that was just outside the strikezone ( a baseball width) and see if it ended up in a favorable result. For now I'm thinking a favorable result would be 

* a ball or a called strike
* a well hit ball
* a foul if there are two strikes in the count

Then do an average of favorable results vs all edge chances. It would be a ""plus"" statistic, so it would be normalized to the whole league. I'm thinking about calling it ""eye+"". It would be sort of peripheral counterpart to OBP and can be used as an indicator for someone who is about to break out of a slump because he's ""seeing the ball well""

"So, I’m 24 and just left baseball. I’ve been very open about my jadedness towards the industry after three years of backbreaking work, false promises, and lots and lots of lessons learned. I worked for three teams, left all of them on very good terms and references, but realized the life is unsustainable. The path to full time really isn’t the undergrad in business/sport management/etc and then moving up through affiliate positions - which is something I’ve come to realize.

Nowadays, I quit. And I’m on the job hunt. However, on LinkedIn, I see all these people making the same decisions I did a few years ago. I frequently have people message me for jobs, advice, etc. Like...a year spent in Pennsylvania at a Sport Info Solutions followed by 2-4 years in video maybe leads to something else full time 10% of the time. I generally now refer to this path as “Video Hell.”

Anyway, I’ve debated opening a blog up for my own Independent work and research. I haven’t completely counted out a return to baseball one day - but it’ll be after I establish myself elsewhere and have more to offer that teams simply can’t provide. I’ve debated a first post about warning people about the track I fell into. And I don’t fully regret my path - but with hindsight being 2020, I’d do my first two years of college working in finance, economics, info tech, etc, work on a blog on the side and then apply to teams to try and skip the affiliate process - or at the very least, just do it for one year.

It just sort of pains me to see people who are 18-20 that are impressionable and always dreamed about wearing a team logo on their chest fall into a similar trap. So in short, would a blog post with some in depth direction be particularly helpful to post on LinkedIn where I have a lot of reach? Would I be sabotaging myself for future opportunities with teams one day in the future (they all know that track being the gateway to FT is BS anyway)?

"I think, from a sabermetric perspective, the consensus of a really good hitter drawing down a bunt is frowned upon - or more so discouraged. However, I've been hating the concept of it more and more, as I've been watching a lot of lower level baseball where I currently reside this summer. 

So, let's say there's a prospect (not necessarily top ranked, but has a batted ball profile that exhibits very strong power but a lot of it is to the pull side and he has trouble chasing a lot of pitches. Teams begin to put down a shift. From a player development perspective for an organization, why at a low level would you have that hitter start dropping bunts to the third base side? 

I get the concept of it - there is nobody at third because of the positioning and if he can learn to drop bunts that way, they may re-think how they position. But, I believe it's a waste of a powerful hitter's strength - and at the lower levels of development, I don't see why he wouldn't be taught to work towards beating the shifts with his mechanics, instead of focusing on bunts. 

I get bunts are part of the game, and it will be taught to everyone at all levels. However, I've seen it a lot this year with gusy who have legitimate power in situations where a bunt isn't needed (a game where they have a large lead already, for instance). 

Is there any defense for that? I just think your taking away that hitter's best qualities and it feels to me that helping him learn to spray the ball a bit more at a low level isn't the best approach.",1

"In the *People* table of the [Lahman database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), there is a column called *finalGame*. The [documentation](http://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2019.txt) states:

&gt; finalGame      Date that player made first major league appearance (blank if still active)

First, I assume that the use of the word 'first' is a copy/paste error (the previous column is *debut*) and it should be 'last'.

But more importantly, the way I am interpreting this is that active players should not have a date here. For example, I would expect that both Carlos Martinez and Matt Carpenter would have a NULL value for this column (assuming I am querying a SQL database). Yet they, and most other active players, do have a date in that column.

The date they have makes sense -- it seems like it's the last game they appeared in. But still, it doesn't match what I would expect.

I should note that I've tried this in the *Lahman* R package and in the SQL Server 2018 version.

"I'm looking at calculating run expectancies given play-by-play data and had a question regarding which base/out state to use for a given play.

Say Mike Trout walks to the plate with Andrelton Simmons standing on first and none out in the inning. The first pitch Trout takes and Simmons legs it for second base, attempting a steal. The count is now either 1-0 or 0-1 and Simmons is either OUT or SAFE. So the at-bat began with a state of 0-100 and now it is either 1-000 or 0-010. Also the count has changed and we are into the at-bat.

The question is: Should we use the play state right before the at-bat is resolved? (i.e. on the pitch the plate appearance ends) or should we use the base/out state as Trout walks to the plate?

My initial thoughts would be to use the state as Trout walks to the plate. This way when we're comparing states with other states, we're always using the same count: 0-0.

I was listening to the Sleeper and the Bust podcast, Steamer Pitching Projections (episode 754), where Paul Sporer mentioned that he believed in Mike Soroka's Home Run Suppression capabilities. 

Mike Soroka had the following stats in 2019: 

ERA: 2.68 

SIERA: 4.17

xFIP: 3.85 

HR/9: 0.72 

HR/FB: 11% 

GB %: 51% 

FB %: 25% 

K/9: 7.3 

Normally I would look at: HR/9, FB%, and HR/FB% in tandem. Perhaps along with the park the guy pitches in, and their velocity. 

League wide HR/9 was 1.40, and HR/FB was 15.3% 

I'm guessing most projection systems will look at the 7.3 DOM, low HR/9, and HR/FB relative to the league average and move his projections closer to the xFIP and SIERA.  Steamer is projecting a 1.16 HR/9, and ERA of 4.12.

"Maybe it seems like a dumb question, but I've had a hard time tracking down the answer. Normally, batting average is calculated in terms of the result of an at-bat. Does that mean that when a hitter has a .278 avg ""against fastballs,"" we're only talking about the fastballs that ended an at-bat? 

That seems a lot more specific and ambiguous than how the stat is usually cited, i.e. as a shorthand for how a hitter will do against a pitcher with a particular repertoire. It doesn't seem to me like it would actually tell us very much on its own--we can't say a hitter ""crushes fastballs"" if we really mean that in particular situations that are more likely to result in at-bats ending they crush fastballs. What if they are great on 3-2 fastballs but frequently watch meatballs early in the count?

I've also read about xwOBA which sounds quite similar. Perhaps the idea is to use the batted ball characteristics to model the probability of each possible batted ball event happening (single, double, triple, or HR), pick the one with highest probability, and call that the ""expected outcome.""

"I was watching u/rfrey22 awesome R videos and thought about how there's this pretty huge barrier for sabermetric newcomers or hobbyist. And that is getting the data in the first place. Often people have experience with a spreadsheet program, like Excel, which can get you a long way honestly, but don't have the programing experience that is necessary to interact with an api or scrape data from the web.

So I'd like to offer my services to those newcomers. Just let me know what type of data you're looking for. I have a bunch of experience pulling down data from statcast, pitchf/x, the mlb-data-api and scrapping baseball-reference.com. I also have some experience with pulling down data from reddit(post, comments, etc.)

I can deliver the data in csv or excel or whatever else you may need.

Here are some interesting, ready to use data that I have in my repo already(in csv form). I always publish the code as well and can answer any questions that you may have.

* [Every draft pick from 1965 to 2019 from mlb data api](https://github.com/double-dose-larry/baseball_draft_data)

* [Every home game attendance 2017-2019 scraped from bref](https://github.com/double-dose-larry/bref_attendance_scrape)

* [Pitch f/x data for every pitch thrown by the Yankees in 2019](https://github.com/double-dose-larry/yankees-pitchfx-data)

* [A short tutorial on how to get clean data from baseball-reference](https://github.com/double-dose-larry/parsing_bref)

There are more [advanced repos](https://github.com/double-dose-larry?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=&amp;language=jupyter+notebook) in there as well, focusing on things like plotting and spacial analysis. feel free to ask questions about those as well.

This comparison only looks at the top five position players at each position according to the PART metric (Arm, Range and Throwing attributable to the player; Positioning to the team) because the rest of this data is not publicly available.

This is mostly a reminder that we shouldn't solely rely on any one defensive metric from one site (at least not yet). The PART metric incorporates the same Statcast data that is an input for OAA, yet the two metrics arrive at different results (both in magnitude and directionality).

"Just generally curious what people think in the first year since really being without nearly all of their key staff writers to teams (Jeff, Dave, Carson). 

I've been out of the loop this past year, as I worked with a team and had little time to read anything outside of what I was doing - so I'm just generally curious. I remember not being in love particularly with any of the new staff members, and found the content to be a bit lackluster - but they are also unfairly being compared to titans of the sabermetrics industry.

"I was just brought on to help bring an analytical approach to my D1 program who has been struggling for some time. We do have a Rapsodo system coming which I will start to dig into but until then, I am attempting to piece together run expectancy matrix's.

I am planning on scraping data for the following:

* The average number of runs that scored, from that base/out state, to the end of that inning.   
* The chance that a run will score at some point in the inning, from each base/out state.
* The frequency of plate appearances that started in each base/out state.  

I do have a couple questions though. If I were to use the conference wide data, the numbers would be for an average baseball team - which we are far from. Would it make more sense to just create the tables using only the teams run states or would that sample size be too small to be effective? If I do use league average, is there a standard practice in terms of comparing your team to the league average?

"Not sure this is the right forum for this question, but here it goes...

I've been giving some thought recently to how large a sample you would need differences in **Brls/BBE** to be statistically significant. As we might remember from Stats 101, the standard construction of a binomial standard error is:

**se=sqrt[p(1-p)/n]**

This essentially assumes a support of [0, 1]. But with something like **Brls/BBE**, we know empirically that the support is more like [0, 0.30]. That is, no one has a **Brls/BBE** of 100%; rather, the upper-bound is somewhere around 30% (it's only exceed 25% twice: Gallo in 2019, Judge in 2017). 

Why not construct the standard error to reflect that support? That is:

**se=sqrt[p(0.3-p)/n]**

Here's an example to illustrate the issue: Say I want to construct a confidence interval for Kyle Lewis (23% in 43 BBE) having a **Brls/BBE** above league-average (6.3%). If I use the regular standard error, then I confidence interval of approximately (0.10, 0.36). That upper-bound seems implausible based on past performance of players over the past five years of Statcast data (i.e., no one has anything close to a 36% **Brls/BBE**). It's also not terribly informative, since the inference is that Lewis is either a bit above average or epically good. 

However, if I use the alternative standard error based on a support of [0, 0.30], the interval shrinks to (0.19, 0.27), which is both more precise and also more plausible on its face. 

To provide some additional context, to get a +/- 0.04 on a 23% **Brls/BBE**, you'd need a sample of about 400 BBE; that is, an order of magnitude greater than the 43 BBE we got from Kyle Lewis in 2019. Obviously more data is always better, but given the relatively narrow support of **Brls/BBE**, shouldn't we be able to narrow down the standard error some?

I've done some looking at some statistics texts, but haven't seen this specifically addressed. Which surprises me, since I would think that it would be widely used if it were mathematically sound given that there are obvious applications besides sabremetrics. So is there an obvious reason why you wouldn't want to do what I'm suggesting?  

Appreciate any insights or suggestions on where to look or who to ask if this approach seems mathematically viable.",1
"I just got the book for Christmas, and I'm trying to work through it, but none of it seems to be working.

"I'm currently reading *The Book*, and am trying to understand some regression to the mean calculations. At the very end of the first chapter ""Toolshed"", the authors give an example regarding 162 players who posted a wOBA of .370 or better for a full season between 2000 and 2003, and who had at least 400 PA in the .370 season and the following season. In the .370 season, they averaged a wOBA of .406. In the next, they averaged .391. At a high level, I understand that this is exactly what regression to the mean is.

However, later, they describe that calculating regression to the mean involves adding a number of average performances to a player's actual performance. In the context of the above example, they say that ""if we want to estimate a player's likely wOBA next season, we need to add approximately 220 average plate appearances to his totals."" My question is: how did they get this number? I've read and re-read the regression section in the appendix to try and understand, but am still a bit confused. In particular, there are some formulas in the appendix that take the form of:

    skill = mean(wOBA) + N/(N + .25/sigma^2)*(wOBA- mean(wOBA)).

Then, they use this formula to find the number of PAs needed to find the break-even point for regression, which is also a bit murky for me.

So, where exactly are these formulas coming from, and how can we use it to figure out the number of PAs, or the ""break-even"" point, for regression to the mean?

Lastly, how is this kind of regression related to a supervised learning technique like ordinary least squares? I've been studying some statistical learning, and it feels like there must be a connection here that might help my understanding!

Thank you for any clarity!",1
"I’ve posted here the other day about some career issues I’m having. I’m 24 and a Sport Management major from a reputable university/program, but I’m obviously not well equipped to be an Analyst with that degree. I’ve worked for three baseball teams and have very solid references and left all three on very good terms with invites to return. The issue is I’m finding no opportunities to grow to full time. I didn’t know when I was 18 and signing up for Sport Management what that landscape would look like - but my current hard skills are very business centric - presentations, speaking, marketing, research, communication, sole analytics and info tech, etc. I finished with a 3.4. I work my absolute tail off. I’m not like a NASA genius, but I’ve finally gained confidence over the past 3 years that I can make a difference. 

Through my work experience with teams, I’ve gained experience with SQL and R, but nothing profoundly complex. Basic queries and visualizations. Nothing crazy, it’s been too inconsistent. I tried a Computer Science program and utterly hated it. Admittedly it was a bad program that’s since closed but I just didn’t like the vibe, the work of developing and coding 24/7, etc. What I love is sort of on the research end. And this will sounds vague. But I love querying large data sets, problem solving, and using analytical data to come to conclusions/projections. If that makes sense.

Anyway, Sport Management is useless - I realize this. But I need to make my Master’s degree count for the money I’m going to spend. I need something useful and unique - but also something where I’ll even be accepted and can thrive from the Sport Management background (for instance, I can’t do a Master’s in Physics. I’m awful at intensive science and have one high school class of it under my belt). I need something where I can become a Data Analyst and be a wide appealing option to multiple fields where earnings are more possible. I want to cast a wider net than sports. I know there’s Business Analytics, Data Science, etc. I just need guidance and don’t know what’s widely useful and renowned, or even where to start. 

Any advice on where I might thrive? It also has to be completely online. Preferably rolling admissions but that’s flexible. I just need help finding the way:

"I’ve posted this once before but wanted to get some additional input if possible. 

Long story short, I’m at a crossroads in my professional baseball career. I’ll be 25 next year and so far I’ve worked for three teams - each year getting more experience and more exposure than the last. All I’ve ever gotten is praise for my position, I’m always one of very few to be invited back, but there’s not much of a path for me to grow.

The past three years have all been affiliate assignments. I was finally able to leave video job hell, but my hours were still full travel, 80 hours a week, and so mentally exhausting. I’m predisposed to depression and the season schedule (14 off days from Feb thru Aug) really did a number on me. Bad hotels hurt, bad dieting, etc. It’s not the life for me anymore and not something I think I need to do anymore. 

I feel accomplished in my field based on feedback alone. I’m not the most confident person but I know every year I’m growing. But as the offseason begins and I’m reaching out and applying, I’m starting to lose hope that a full time job is attainable. I will sacrifice and work long hours and kill myself for my dream job - but the affiliate schedule is no longer doable. I need to find one place to live for at least two years and be able to both work and prioritize my mental health - and I don’t think I’m weak for acknowledging that. 

Okay, this has been sort of a rant. But, I’m genuinely looking for advice what to do next. I cold message 30 people a day on LinkedIn, i cold email, etc. Skill wise, I’m not a computer scientist - but I just got admitted to grad school. But I can’t start it until I have a location set and I know I can handle it. I tried it in season and it was way too overwhelming, I have very basic code ability, and worked on it pretty extensively hands on this year, but I couldn’t do anything consistently because the travel utterly kills me. 

I’m just wondering if there’s a place for me in baseball. I do need some kind of sustainable income. I live alone and don’t come from much of any privilege. I go on LinkedIn and all these people from MIT, who worked at NASA, studied finance, and it’s not me. I went to a good school for a business degree and was admitted to a good grad school, but sometimes I think it isn’t enough. I have so many good references though. And I haven’t gotten FT simply because it hasn’t been there. But I have recommendations from MLB analysts, MLB hitting coaches, PD Staff etc all telling me I do well. And I know my greatest strengths are  communication, empathy and thinking outside the box. But, I don’t know what’s next. I need something more doable for my mental health - and because I feel there’s nothing left for me growth-wise at the same old affiliate jobs. I don’t want to give up on this dream, but I’m on my fourth year of the hunt and the stress of the offseason is excruciating. Any input or advice would mean a lot. Sorry for the length",1

Is there any website providing the unprocessed run expectation values?

Yet they still pay six figures for entry level engineers. If the pay is so low, are the candidates 'really' that good?

"Long story short, I’ve been working in pro ball for about three years now - each year getting more in depth roles than the last. I have a lot of really good references, and I’ve been told by everyone I’ve gone above and beyond and killed myself to stand out....but each September it ends with me jobless, on the hunt, and filling out questionnaires. 

Honestly, I feel burned out. I love baseball. It’s my life and I know I’ll never be truly fulfilled doing anything else. But, I didn’t just put cameras up for teams this year - I was very involved and put everything I had in. And things just didn’t pan out, no openings. And I’m just tired. Tired from road travel, intense work, 80 hour weeks....I’m not doing it again next year, not that schedule. I need to find some sort of full-time job by now. 

I’ll do my usual cold emails and getting in touch with people I know, but I’m tired of the process. It’s so stressful not having a job every 7-8 months, and feeling like all my work has been for nothing. And I won’t give up, but I’m not the same 20 year old who could afford this financially, mentally, or even physically. 

At this point....I’m trying to cast a wide net. To people who have been in my spot and can relate or otherwise, does anyone know of other companies where I can do a similar line of work in baseball, but just where the schedule is less agonizing and there’s more consistency? I just don’t know the path. I’m still young, but I sacrificed mind/body/soul with the schedule I had this year, and I cannot do it again. And I don’t think I’m weak for doing so.

But...does anyone have any tips on companies where maybe I can be of assistance? Or someone with a pretty decent background in baseball who has proven themselves with teams?",1

"Every serious baseball fan agrees that game location can affect the outcome of the game. This ""park effect"" is difficult to measure. If known, it could be used to hypothesize game results when the park effect was removed thus providing an apples-to-apples set of performance measurements of teams and players. Different methods for measuring park effect have been proposed and there is general agreement as to which MLB parks are batter-friendly and which are pitcher-friendly. For example, in 2018 the Rockies' Coors Field is considered the most batter-friendly and the Oakland Coliseum is at the least batter-friendly and therefore the most pitcher-friendly.

RunPlusMinus has developed unique performance statistics that not only measure the on-field performance of the four components (batting, running, pitching, fielding) but more important RunPlusMinus provides a single numeric measure representing the composite performance of each player. This RunPlusMinus Rating statistic allows offensive and defensive players to be compared on the same scale. 

The article [Park Effect: Measurement and Impact on Team and Player Performance](https://medium.com/runplusminus/park-effect-measurement-and-impact-on-team-and-player-performance-24162e48d18c) describes the importance, challenges and sources of park effect data.

"Hi everybody. I manage a men's league team and I've been trying to figure out which stat I can implement to reveal my best offensive players. I'd love to get this group's thoughts and guidance...  

Last year I relied mostly on wOBA, which seemed to work fairly well but I think it had some limitations. wOBA is for weighted the highest level of competition, so it discounts some of the variance of ability level found in lower levels of play a little too much for my purposes. So I set out to see how other coaches apply advanced stats at these levels. After reading [this article](https://www.crawfishboxes.com/2013/5/23/4360702/high-school-and-sabr-part-2-offensive-philosophy), the coach/author reaches a conclusion that I very much agree with: getting on base and putting balls in play is even more valuable at lower levels to put pressure on defenses and allow them to make mistakes and benefit your team.  

So now I'm trying to see if I can adjust these well-established stats to account for the non-MLB ability levels found in our league. I've come up with a slightly modified version of wOBAbip. I'm using the [FanGraphs weights](https://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/woba/) for the numerator. For the denominator, I started with babip's but I took out home runs because I want this to be a primarily offensive measure of a player's weighted offensive value so I want to count HR's as balls in play. So here's the formula...  

[(0.69*BB)+(0.72*HBP)+(0.89*(1B+RBOE))+(1.27*2B)+(1.62*3B)+(2.1*HR)]/(AB-K+SF)

It was meant to replace pitcher wins and losses by scoring each pitcher's contribution to the game, so that if, say, a starting pitcher pitches nine dominant innings in a  0-0 game, but gets pulled for the 10th and is not the pitcher of record when his team scores a walk-off run in extra innings, he would still be credited with the highest score and thus the highest contribution.

The frontend is an Apache open source data analysis tool called Superset which allows for real time querying of the data along with dashboards that can visualize data. We have automated the pulling and parsing of data so DingerDB will always remain up to date.

**What is the purpose?**

- We had the inspiration from retrosheets and the lahman database to try and make something that included current data that had much more granularity than both of those that included modern data such as pitchfx. We also thought it would be interesting to try and figure out any correlations derived from the verbose data.

**Who are we?**

- We are a few software engineers who enjoy baseball and have some experience with data processing and indexing so it seemed like a good idea for a side project. With that said, if there are any features that are requested we will try to accommodate them as best we can if they are possible and our schedules allow for it.

**What do we want?**

- To promote the use of DingerDB by providing a reliable, easy to use, and up to date source of baseball data.

**How do I get access?**

- Its now open to the public!

- [DingerDB](https://dingerdb.com/superset/sqllab)

**What's new with DingerDB?**

- We've made it so you can access the sqllab page directly without having to have an account! Now you can query without having to ask us for a login.

**Why would I have a login in the first place?**

- If you want to save queries or dashboards to your personal space then you will still need a login.

**What can I do to help?**

- We've a patreon here with various options, all proceeds will go improving the site and hosting fees for larger instances or site improvements.

I'm looking for someone that is familiar with R or Python to help me out with a project involving Baseball Savants Statcast data. Message me on here if you are interested in collaborating.,1
Does anyone know of a good source of current RE24 values that has separate tables for each park?,1
"I am currently working on a predictive injury model for pitchers using MLB DL data from 2010 to 2017. I figured that grouping injuries into categories would be informative for the model (grouping by certain body parts/injuries and their severity). I attempted to do this through machine learning but the model outcome was not exactly intuitive.

At this point I feel it may be easier to group the injuries manually. I have done some research into it, but would appreciate suggestions for categories or resources that would be helpful in determining the categories. ",1
"As a part of a class project, we had to propose and calculate two new statistics. For my project, I created the following two statistics. A full [proposal](https://github.com/brandonzink/Sabermetrics-Project/blob/master/Project%20Proposal.pdf), [write-up](https://github.com/brandonzink/Sabermetrics-Project/blob/master/Project%20Writeup.pdf), [explanation video](https://youtu.be/4OFdErojqLs), and [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/brandonzink/Sabermetrics-Project) can be found at those links.
  
#**%TBA**  
  
%TBA is a calculation similar to RBI. Instead of only valuing when a runner crosses the plate, this statistic values any amount of movement on the bases, unweighted on which bases are moved (going from second to home carries the same value as going first to third). It then weights the total bases advanced by all baserunners (including the batter) divided by the total possible bases (if every runner crossed home). It is not a cumulative statistic, but instead adds up both TBA (total bases advanced) and TPBA (total possible bases advanced) over a season, then divides.  
  
Ex: With runners on first and second, the batter hits a single that scores the runner from second and moves the runner from first to second.  
TBA = 2 (second to home) + 2 (first to third) + 1 (batter to first)  
TPBA = 2 (second to home) + 3 (first to home) + 4 (batter to home)  
%TBA = 5 TBA / 9 TPBA = 0.555  
This is a pretty good result from the AB, as a groundout that moved no one would result in a 0/9 = 0.000 score for that play.  
  


Player | Year | %TBA | WAR
------|----|----|---
Mike Trout | 2012 | 0.272 | 10.5
Joey Votto | 2010 | 0.265 | 7.0
Paul Goldschmidt | 2013 | 0.261 | 7.1  
  
The top 3 players from my samples (2010 - 2015) are shown above as a reference. Mike Trout was dick-slapping everyone around in 2012, and it shows in his %TBA. Votto and Goldy both had very good seasons in their appropriate years, and it also shows in their %TBA.   
  
#**REC**  
REC (Runs Earned Created) is not dissimilar to the %TBA stat but instead uses the RE24 table to weight the outcome of a play. REC is also a cumulative stat (which is eventually it's downfall and looking retrospectively, I probably should've done a %REC stat). REC takes the RE24 value from the end of a play, subtracts the RE24 at the start of the play, and adds the total runs scored over that play.  
  
Ex: With runners on first and second and one out, the batter hits a single that scores the runner from second and moves the runner from first to second.  
RE24 before play = 0.884  
RE24 after play = 1.13  
Runs scored = 1  
REC = (1.13 - 0.884) + 1 = 1.246  
The play not only scored a run but also increased the expected number of runs for the next guy at the plate, making this an extremely good player. A negative play can happen as well, especially hurtful ones are stuff like GIDP.  


Player | Year | REC | WAR
------|----|---|---
Chris Davis | 2013 | 158.4 | 6.5
Miggy Cabrera | 2011 | 158.3 | 7.6
Hunter Pence | 2011 | 156 | 5.8
  
Looking at that list, you can pretty immediately tell that this stat has its flaws. It's far too AB dependent (if you watch the explanation video, you can see a graph that really shows it). I don't consider REC to be a particularly good stat, but who knows, maybe you like AB dependent stats dominated by good to great players. I guess you could use it to knock Mike Trout.

This leads to discrepancies of, for example, 20 points at times - I calculated a .332 2017 wOBA using pitch by pitch wOBA. 

That being said, for anyone who uses pitch by pitch data, how do you calculate and use wOBA? Standard or use weights, or what?",1

"I am very new to this forum and reddit in general (this is my first reddit post ever) so please forgive me if this is an improper post....  

I am interested in creating a metric that measures how strongly a manager should consider intentionally walking a batter.  What I envision is something that accounts for the runs saved by issuing an intentional walk (affected by the runners-on-base state and the number of outs) and is weighted according to the leverage index of the situation.  Ideally the metric would be scaled from 0 to 1 for ease of use in game situations, with a value of, say, 0.99 meaning that a manager should issue an intentional walk basically every time, while a value of 0.1 would mean a manager should only issue an intentional walk in the most unfavorable 10% of matchup situations.  My theory is that managers misuse the intentional walk quite often because they typically face the decision in high pressure situations and are forced to decide quickly with imperfect information (they cant know if their pitcher will execute good pitches or if the hitter will swing at bad pitches etc...) and thus such a metric would be helpful in optimizing decision making.  In practice, the metric would serve as a baseline with the manager's intuition coming in to play when considering how unfavorable a given matchup is (which of course depends on many factors such as the hitter on deck, pitcher/hitter performance on that day, whether a given hitter is hot, past pitcher/hitter matchup data etc...).  Does anybody have any knowledge of something similar existing, or any advice on where I could start with regards to creating something new? As I said, this is my first post, so feedback of any type is appreciated.

I've downloaded the results csv files from baseball savant site. I finally got them all into a MySQL database just for one team to do some test queries. I noticed that some data is wrong. I've tried multiple different ways of importing to make sure it wasn't an error on my end. For instance in 2017 it says Joe Mauer only had 62 walks when Fangraphs and Baseball Reference sites say he had 66. Another example is it says Brian Dozier had 35 homers in 2017 when in fact he had 34. If this simple data is wrong when I'm doing calculations for OBP and wOBA they are going to be skewed. Has anyone else experienced anything like this. Or can anyone point me in the direction of where I can get files of all pitch data for seasons?,1

I was not convinced so I went through many data points, cross referencing their videos and estimated the position the ball was fielded at. 
My estimates were very different from a quick linear transformation using the origin (130,210).   Specifically hc_y was hard to nail down. These coordinates are definitely not in feet and do not seem linear. The error was not constant and increased as the ball was hit further making me think that these coordinates come from an angled view.

"I've read a lot of discussions comparing players with similar OPS, and the point always comes up that if two players have an identical OPS (really, an identical OPS+), the one with the higher OBP and lower SLG is the more valuable. There's even a conversion such that 1 point of OBP is actually worth (to make up a value for illustrative purposes) 1.5 points of slugging. 

I assume that this comes from detailed analyses showing that OBP is a better predictor of scoring more runs. However, I've never seen the data that lead to this conclusion, and it recently occurred to me that maybe part of the difference is in the two measures having different denominators. To be more precise, since OBP has plate appearances as its denominator, and SLG has at bats (which by definition will never be more than PA, and in practice will always be smaller than PA), it takes more of whatever quantity comprises your numerator (times on base or total bases, respectively) to raise your value by one point. 

If we could come up with a measure for slugging that was based on plate appearances instead of at bats, would that measure be closer to OBP in predictive value? There are, of course, some serious logistical problems: either you include non-hit times on base, in which case you're both amalgamating OBP and SLG, and also creating a cap of sorts for players who walk a lot, since each walk can only generate a single base; or you exclude non-hit times on base, in which case you're penalizing players who walk a lot because their denominator will increase by much more than players who don't. 

I'm not sure it's possible to create this hypothetical SLG based on plate appearances in any useful way. But if it *were* possible, how far would that go in equalizing the value of OBP and SLG in comparing players?",1

"From reading a lot of the more advanced sabermetric papers in the public, I've noticed a high usage of mixed effects models. I understand that these models are generally used because they can account for correlation between the response variable throughout the dataset. However, something that I find puzzling is that these mixed effects models are often used to actually estimate the value of the random effect. In my experience in statistics, mixed effects models are generally used to account for correlated data, but the inclusion of these random effects are just variance adjustments where the purpose of the model is to more accurately estimate the impact of the fixed effects on the response, and they are generally not explicitly estimated.

Take for example this article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-baseballs-exit-velocity-is-five-parts-hitter-one-part-pitcher/

Here, a random effects model is used, and each random effect for different pitchers is estimated. This seems somewhat odd to me and inconsistent with what I've learned in classes.

Now I need your help! I want to refine the charts and put them in a dashboard so you can see those for every team and player. But for that I have to calculate the Left on Base stat. They are there for Teams, this is why I can test my calculation, but not for players. I'm using data from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com/) and here is what I have so far:

I calculate people who came on base like this: Hits (without HRs) + BB (both IBB and UBB) + HBP + Catchers Interference + Reached on Error.

Then, in order to calculate the LOB from this number of people who reached base I substract:Runs (without HRs), Caught Stealing, Pickoff and Out on Base.

The problem is, when I compare this constructed LOB with the actual statistic from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com/) I constantly have around 100 too many LOBs in my constructed number (for Teams). So there must be something every other game that I'm missing and I can't figure it out.

Either I'm counting too less people who reached base or I forget something how else people who are on base can get out or something else. I'm not sure about the Grounded into Double Play but when I take them in I construct a bit too less LOBs.

How else can one get on base or how else can someone get out etc.?

Help really appreciated!",1
"As a part of my undergrad thesis, I'm looking to create a short-term player projection model (~2 weeks) for a fairly common array of statistics (BA, OBP, SLG, HR%, K%, BB%). However, I've run into some issues and was looking for some input/ideas from the baseball minds here.  
  
I began by using a recency weighted function applied to the last n games (anywhere from 5 to 500 games back) and comparing them to the most recent two weeks of data for every starting player in the MLB. If the sample size was insufficient (rookies, etc.), I created a composite stat of their stats in the small sample size and replacement level (I found this to be better than MLB average), with weights determined by the sample size. The correlation coefficients were low (anywhere from .200 to .500). I removed the recency weighted function and this improved the coefficients slightly, but still not into an acceptable range.  
  
I then took a different approach and got every stat I could find for every major league starter and ran a linear regression on the stats from above over the most recent two weeks. This created a model that had significant inputs (p val &lt;.05) but a weak R-Squared and Adj. R-Squared values (.150 to .250).  
  
In examining plots of the data comparing the most recent two weeks of stats versus the last 100 games, I found that BA, OBP, and SLG were essentially a giant blob (with some linear correlation but minimal), HR% shows no signs of a correlation (there are also quite a few players with a HR% of .000 over the last two weeks), and BB% and K% had the most obvious linear correlation. I tried adjusting for the ""blobiness"" of BA, OBP, and SLG by eliminating any players that were especially streaky (their standard deviation for the specific stat was at least double the MLB average standard deviation). This improved both the correlation coefficients and R-Squared values, but still not into a particularly acceptable range.  
  
My next best guess is to use a publicly available projection system (Steamer, Zips) and see which projects best over a short-term period. Do any of you have any additional ideas or comments regarding a way to improve my methodology? Any help is appreciated!",1

"This will be in depth post about me and my love for baseball.

So I’m a 16 year old (sophomore in high school) and in the past couple years my interest for baseball has piqued. Personally, I’ve never played the sport competitively other then little league, but I’ve started to love watching the sport after my fandom of the packers started to wane. I grew up in a a Suburb of Chicago for my first 14 years where football was my number one sport. I was an avid Packers fan (both my parents went to college in Wisconsin, my Dad lived in a town near Milwaukee his whole life and has a lot of his family there), as a young football fan I was pretty invested into the Packers but as I grew older the packers started to become less functional and during the long stretches of the off season I found myself bored and found my love in baseball. As a 5th grader I intently remember following the brewers for the first time, and was devastated after they collapsed in 2014. I took a break but then moving to California  in 2017 I became obsessed to the Brewers. My friends were also baseball enthusiasts and I found it as a great way to connect. The 2017 season passed and my interest for football started to considerably wane and baseball became my number 1 sport.  I followed the off season greatly and my baseball interest heightened greatly in 2018. (Admittedly because the brewers were an elite team this year). However in 2018 my interest for sabermetrics  kicked in and I discovered Fangraphs (I don’t use baseball reference) and twitter. I started to use advanced stats and I got a blogging job at Fansided. 

For the past couple years baseball has been one of my passions but I don’t know how to apply it to my real life. I’m a pretty good student in school however I don’t take that many advanced classes. I play tennis, and am pretty well rounded but i want to use my passion into something that will help me when I go to college. Other interests I have are finance, econ and statistics. I’m not sure exactly what I want to do in college but something involving analytics and baseball (like moneyball) would be great. 

My dad is a software engineer in San Francisco and has encouraged me how to learn how to code, (js) and after trying it out I did not like it. 

So I was wondering if you guys could give me a nudge in the right direction, I’m looking on how to start a cool baseball project or something that would be meaningful in my life for the off season. Thanks guys.",1

"Last year, I worked with a collegiate summer team working with the manager to calculate &amp; keep advanced stats. I had a working spreadsheet that I would plug and they would spit out the numbers I wanted. I used this to try &amp; translate what he was seeing on the field to put a value on certain aspects. One problem was that I was doing it remotely as I lived too far away. There was a live stream that I would occasionally watch but I just was not able to devote as much time to watch every game as I wanted. I would essentially go into the box score and use the information there to get what I needed &amp; throw it into spreadsheets. Thankfully, it was a pretty detailed box score which included pitch by pitch sequences.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I was thinking about this upcoming summer and was wondering what recommendations or ideas this group might have.  I was able to calculate the basic stats (OBP, OPS, SLG, ERA) as well as most traditional advanced stats (wOBA, WRC+, FIP, splits &amp; situational stats, etc) that allow me to dive a little bit deeper but my main goal was to see if anybody had any ideas or suggestions on how I could further read between the lines. In other words, how can I use what information I typically get to further myself as well as provide more value to the team and manager that I am working with. Thanks!",1
"So, I've applied for several positions with MLB teams. Did a questionnaire back in late September and never heard back. 

I'd just like to know if I'm still being considered or not, but don't want to come off as impatient - I'd just like to know if I'm still being considered. 

So, I guess I'm wondering if it's wrong or hurts my chances to ask a team what my chances are, or where I stand? Just not sure if I should still be holding out hope - not sure how it works in this industry. I'm sure there's hundreds of questionnaires sent out anyways. ",1
I'm interested in unusual events in baseball. I know the [Cubs](https://www.mlb.com/news/giants-protest-upheld/c-90604930) almost had to forfeit a game a few years back and the Senators forfeited a game when fans stormed the field because they were angry that the team was leaving DC (the end of the [radio broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDQF1XYuGBE) is worth a listen). Has a game ever been forfeited because of misconduct by players or coaches?,1
"Watching the Cubs the last few years, I’ve noticed that Ben Zobrist constantly flies out to the warning track, barely missing countless homeruns. This has made me imagine if Wrigley field was a few feet smaller—Zobrist’s production would skyrocket. Thus, I was thinking that a smaller ballpark, like yankee stadium, might benefit more from having Ben zobrist than the cubs. 

Another simpler example is the necessity of having groundball pitchers in a Colts Field (to prevent homeruns). So, I was wondering how I could go about researching this topic and collecting relevant stats.

Any ideas? ",1
"I was wondering if triple-A teams have sports analytics department that I could potentially intern for. Over the summer I’m going to be in a city with a triple-A team, but no major league team.

I have uploaded the 200 Volumes so they are downloadable. They are in three formats (EPUB, MOBI and TXT) so you can use whichever you prefer. For the EPUB and MOBI formats the Volumes include tables of content so they're easy to navigate in readers (that's basically the whole point of doing this).

I need a little help sparking my researching method for this question I have. I’m trying to find the percentage of times a manager will call on the teams closer in the ninth inning specifically in relation to the run. I’m envisioning a chart that would look someone like this:

X axis- Game Run Differential (i.e. -1,0,1,2,3,4)
Y axis- % of time team CLOSER is brought in to game

If anybody has an idea as to how I would go about this problem that would be phenomenal. I’m not scared to dive into some R code if necessary, but I’m not sure which dataset I would need to query to achieve this.

Thank you!!",1

"I recently received a job offer from a team that was more of a safety net for next year. I am still waiting on two other teams for jobs I really want to make their decision on my job status.

How do you go about emailing teams asking for decisions? These teams are my top two priorities, so I don't want to turn them off. But at the same time, I don't want them both to end up rejecting me, I'll have long missed my deadline, and then end up with nothing.

"I've been recently trying to create an independent project that correlates player performance with the impact of travel at the minor league level. I have about a season's worth of data from when I had worked with an independent league last season. 

On the basis of all of this, the simplest way to look at it would be is exit velocity/pitch velocity impacted by miles travelled? Would a pitcher be benefitted by flying out a day early, opposed to traveling with the team on a long bus trip the day of? That's kind of the base, but I want to see if there are more variables that also may be in accordance to really being able to create something interesting. 

So, I guess I'm wondering what else would be good to account for. Break on pitches, launch angle, usage trends, rest, workouts, etc. Just things I can quantify (I know rest and nutrition would be nearly impossible to make a general consensus). But, firstly I'm wondering if this may be something teams would be interested in - and secondly, what else I could account for to just make this more intriguing as a concept. 

Developing projects is always the most difficult part for me. The actual execution is fine, but I'm having trouble and could use some brainstorming. ",1

However, his 2015 offensive WAR was somehow significantly less than 2014?!

"Here is a note that proposes a new novel method for directly calculating wins above replacement:

[https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/5/2398/files/2019/03/causalWARyadi-1mwhtjl.pdf](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/5/2398/files/2019/03/causalWARyadi-1mwhtjl.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some interesting excerpts in the attached paper:

&amp;#x200B;

Wins above replacement (WAR) is meant to be a one-number summary of the total contribution made by a player for his team in any particular season.  As stated by Steve Slowinski of Fangraphs, WAR offers an estimate to answer the question, 

  \`\`If this player got injured and their team had to replace them with a  freely available player of lower quality from their bench, how much value would the team be losing,'' 

where this value is expressed in number of wins \[citation in paper\].  That being said, nobody actually calculates WAR in a manner that properly answers the above question as posed.  This is not by any fault of the metric and those who calculate it.  One problem is that it is impossible to simultaneously quantify the value of a player when the player is available and the value of a replacement to that player when the player is unavailable.  The player in question is either available to play or unavailable to play, never both.  Instead of confronting the problems raised in this factual-counterfactual world, people have attempted to calculate a hypothetical replacement player to implicitly compare every player with using the machinery of a proprietary black box \[citation in paper\].  Three widely used versions of WAR that are calculated in this manner are Baseball Reference's bWAR \[citation in paper\], Fangraphs's fWAR \[citation in paper\], and Baseball Prospectus's bWARP \[citation in paper\].

&amp;#x200B;

In this note, we propose a direct estimator of wins above replacement that confronts the difficulty of the factual-counterfactual real world.  Note that there are numerous examples of seasons in which a player is available and unavailable for a substantial amount of time.  When this is so, we can directly compare how the team performs when the player is available to how the team performs when the player is unavailable.  This framework allows for a direct estimation of the wins that a player adds above a replacement player. This direct estimator is relatively simple to compute, available, easy to understand, and its interpretation is flexible to the narrative of a season. We will refer to this direct calculation of WAR as dWAR, which is short for direct WAR, which is shorthand for the direct calculation of wins above replacement. The dWAR estimator has the potential to yield a much more natural and appropriate estimate of WAR than those which involve the calculation of a hypothetical replacement player via black box methodology.  The validity of dWAR depends on the team and the competition faced by the team being similar duringboth player states.  Very nuanced interpretations of what dWAR measures emerge when team makeup is confounded with the availability of the player in question. 

&amp;#x200B;

We primarily focus on the 2014 Yadier Molina season to show the discrepancies between conventional calculations of WAR and dWAR.  Our version of WAR gives much more value to Yadier Molina's 2014 season than conventional versions.  This result is far from surprising.  Many note that conventional versions of WAR do not properly account for leadership, game management, pitch framing, and catcher defense, which are all aspects of baseball that Molina excels at \[citations in paper\].  That being said, a tangible numeric value of the additional Cardinals wins attributable to Molina as a result of these intangible traits has not existed until now.  We caution against generalizing our findings beyond the 2014 season with certainty, but we hope that the point is taken and can be used to strengthen Molina's case for the Hall of Fame.  The point here being that conventional versions of WAR likely have underestimated the number of Cardinals wins attributable to Yadier Molina by a substantial amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

We hope that dWAR can help strengthen Yadier Molina's deserving Hall of Fame case.  **It is entirely within the realm of possibility that conventional calculations of WAR will have underestimated Yadier Molina's career WAR by 10-30 wins when he retires.**

&amp;#x200B;

The 2017 Mike Trout season was truly mind-boggling and it illustrates the collective shortcomings of all metrics, including dWAR.  The dWAR estimator of Mike Trout's value to the 2017 Angels is valid in the sense that the 2017 Angels performed almost as well without Mike Trout as they performed with him.  That is what happened and it is not debatable. However, using this as a final determination of Mike Trout's value is very suspect.  Perhaps the \`\`Mike Trout effect'' is real and perhaps it is a result of either lackadaisical uninspired teammates, poor leadership on Mike Trout's part, poor team management, or all of the above, or possibly some other explanation.  Even if this effect exists, it has only been shown to exist with respect to the 2017 Angels season and it may not exist in any other year or on any other team.  Conventional indirect estimates of WAR provide a one-number summary of how statistically dominant Mike Trout was and currently is.  To what extent this raw context neutral statistical account of Mike Trout's greatness can translate to actual wins above replacement is an honest conversation worth having by fans, historians, scouts, sabermetricians, the baseball media, and team executives alike.

&amp;#x200B;

As it currently stands, dWAR can only validly estimate WAR for a player during a season in which the player spent a substantial time in both the available and unavailable states.  Since the calculation of dWAR is constrained to one season in isolation, it cannot be used to properly compare players across eras for reasons noted in [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc\_challenging\_nostalgia\_and\_performance\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc_challenging_nostalgia_and_performance_metrics/). Valid era-invariant extensions to dWAR for all player seasons can be made with a suitable era-invariant model of the probabilities of team success that are central to the calculation of dWAR.  This is not a trivial task and we speculate that strong structural assumptions in a partially Bayesian latent variable modeling framework would be required to achieve believable era-invariance.  

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to emphasize that traditional considerations of value including leadership ability, winning attitude, clutch performances, great defense, and other intangibles are important supplements to statistical accounts of value.  Our metric dWAR can contribute to this emphasis by measuring to what extent an aggregation of these previously unmeasurable accounts of value has on the additional number of wins a particular player produces for his team over that of a suitable and available replacement player.  If intangible value actually helps a team win when a player is on the field, then dWAR can find it when conventional calculations of WAR such as bWAR, fWAR, and BWARP will not. These conventional calculations of WAR are not actually in the business of directly calculating wins above replacement, dWAR is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Concluding rant: I would like to note that the Yadier Molina Hall of Fame case has a notable skeptic in Mr. Brian Kenney.  In a segment of MLB Now (see here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS4gH9WiEP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS4gH9WiEP0)), Mr. Kenney voices that he does not think that Yadier Molina is a future Hall of Famer and he builds an analytical case against Molina based largely on conventional versions of WAR and OPS+.  I find that his analysis is completely void of any merit. He cherry picks stats that are not suitable for the comparisons that he is making (as noted heavily in my other paper [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc\_challenging\_nostalgia\_and\_performance\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9sd4rh/oc_challenging_nostalgia_and_performance_metrics/)), and he ignores or minimizes intangible value that is obviously associated with winning games. I hope that dWAR can offer some clarifications that are in favor of the deserving Hall of Fame case for Yadier Molina.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; I am proposing a new estimator of WAR, called dWAR that is capable of directly calculating WAR for players that have a season in which they spend substantial time as an available player and an unavailable player. The dWAR estimator has the potential to yield a much more natural and appropriate estimate of WAR than those which involve the calculation of a hypothetical replacement player via black box methodology.  Take special note that the validity of dWAR depends on the team and the competition faced by the team being similar during both player states.  Very nuanced interpretations of what dWAR measures emerge when team makeup is confounded with the availability of the player in question. ",1

"Over the past few months, I feel I have a solid understanding of SQL and Python. More so SQL, I think of it as actually decently simple for queries to pull data utilized in baseball analysis. However, I'm now trying to learn R. This one, I'm not familiar with at all. I also own a Mac exclusively, which doesn't help much. And I'm a broke grad student, with limited funds.

Would anyone have a recommendation for learning R Studio (or whatever suite teams utilize) to create visualizations with SQL data? Honestly a means to learn to integrate both would be perfect. It doesn't take me super long to pick things up, but I'm a little intimidated and would love to have a crash course - as I have a position in baseball (collegiate) beginning and I'd like to continue building versatility.

"I'm slowly working thru an idea for a tabletop baseball game that I have. The basic mechanism is 1) draw a card from a deck of 52: Face cards (23%) point to an individual defense card, Red numbered cards (38.5%) point to an individual hitter's card, Black numbered cards (38.5%) point to an individual pitcher's card. Then you roll percentile dice for the outcome from the specific player card.

There will be 14/100 chances 'on average' for a 1B. Right now, I've got 5.39/100 (38.5%) 1Bs coming from the hitter's card, 5.39/100 (38.5%) 1Bs coming from the pitcher's card, and 3.22/100 (23%) 1Bs coming from the defense cards. But I know that pitchers have far less control over the outcome of BIPs than hitters. I don't know how it relates to defense.  So, my question is, who should get 'credit' for the 1B outcomes? Or, how to balance the 1B outcomes so that it reflects how much is attributable to a hitter/pitcher/defender skill in real life?",1
"The past two years I've interned with Major League Baseball teams - affiliate jobs, mostly video and technologies.

I was sought out by teams, I filled out at least 25 questionnaires, and honestly never received anything but positive feedback. 

Anyway, I didn't get a job this season. I understand the field is competitive and I understand you'll hear no more than you hear yes. But, I can't live on a seasonal internship life anymore. To be honest, I spent all my money I saved for years to pursue this, relocate, etc. I don't come from much wealth or excessive privilege. I'm very middle of the road, middle class, and extremely hardworking. But again, I realize that doesn't guarantee you anything. 

In the offseason, I kept jumping from retail job to retail job trying to make a living and never getting hours. No matter what. Those jobs for some reason were also brutal. I have a strong undergraduate business degree and have been working on my Master's. But, I'm on the verge of complete homelessness at the end of this month. I don't know what to do, because this is all I've done since I finished my undergraduate studies.

To me, having no quality of life is no longer worth it. I've applied everywhere I can think of. ESPN, STATS LLC, Catapult, etc. I'll do marketing, business development, it really doesn't matter. I'm just tired of Spaghetti-O's for dinner. 

I so don't mean to have a pity party, I'm just now in an immense spot of difficulty and I can't think of other companies where this might be a fit. I'd like to return one day maybe when I have savings, but as a 23 year old, going on 24, I can't live this way anymore and need to ask for help on suggestions on what to do next.

"TL;DR: Newbie - best practice question about calculating values in SQL before python import, or after python import in dataframe.

Hi all,

Dipping my toes into the world of sabermetrics because 1) I love baseball, and 2) I'd like to practice SQL and Python for data analysis. Apologies in advance if this is a dumb question.

I've always been intrigued by the concept of WAR, and want to have a better understanding of the underlying calculation. I'd like to not simply strip WAR from BaseballReference, and instead calculate it completely from scratch (right now, actual analysis is taking the backseat to skill development). End goal would be to validate my calculation vs. that of official bWAR measures.

Right now my current tools are - 
1. SQL (I imported Lahman's 2016)
2. Python (libraries include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Now, my question... I'm wondering what the best practice is for calculating tons of values/columns that are not inherent to a database in new columns. For example - Lahman's does not contain 1B, which needs to be calculated as H - HR - 3B - 2B. Would it be preferable for me to create a view in SQL that has all the desired values for calculating WAR, or should I simply take the raw data and import to python and calculate these columns in a dataframe? I started this process via the dataframe route, and have found the data cleaning process to be more frustrating than expected..

So I'm trying to do some analysis on the effect of location on team performance. I've looked through the major data sources but haven't had luck finding what I am looking for. The key stats needed are the teams that played (obviously) and the location of the game. I can find the information easily on [MLB.com](https://MLB.com) but it is not in an easily exportable file. I'm also hoping to look at multiple seasons. Does anyone know where I could find this data? Thank you so much!,1
"I'm attempting to create a predictive model for player performance given their current match up using an array of different statistics. I have box score and play by play data for each game over the past 6 seasons and will be utilizing that to calculate each player's stats current to each game they played. It's not too difficult to manually calculate basic stats like AVG and K/9, however more advanced stats like wOBA and wRC+ require a little more effort. Using fangraph's guts page ([https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn](https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn)) is helpful for obtaining each season's weights for calculating stats, but I feel as though it's inadequate for my specific purpose. For instance, if I'm calculating what a player's wOBA was as of June 3, 2015; wouldn't I be utilizing future information if I simply plugged in 2015's linear weights into the wOBA formula? I say this because these weights are calculated using league-wide statistics for the entire 2015 season. I'm curious how a website like Fangraphs or BP would calculate wOBA within each season, given that with each game played the linear weights should slightly change due to the fact that the league's stats are continuously changing. I'm also particularly interested with what they do for the very beginning of the season where simply isn't much information available yet; do they just use the previous season's weights or weigh the early season's weights with the previous season's? I understand this is a little nitpicky and I could probably just use the previous season's weights or general weights, but I'm trying to be thorough with this and would like to do it the right way, if possible. Anyways I'd be very appreciative of any feedback on this topic and look forward to hearing what ideas you guys have!",1
"  

With the first game of Spring Training 2019 hovering a month away, here is a peek at the top prospects from the Seattle and Oakland clubs. I’ve selected one hitter and one pitcher for each team. One of my four picks was ranked No. 1 on mlb.com, but the other three were not – here’s why they should be.

Mariners Prospect Batter: Dom Thompson-Williams.

Thompson-Williams is a power hitter, simply put. His 368 at bats have garnered a .909 OPS for this 23 year old slugger. The early twenties often show an increase in strength, and thus, power. Thompson-Williams has a 25% K avg – he gets a hit 75% of the time. This is a guy to watch out for.

Mariners Prospect Pitcher: Matt Festa.

25-year-old Festa has a low runs allowed average, and get this – 20 saves. He is in the top 4 of Mariners prospects, and for good reason. His ERA sits at 2.67. 

Alright, now for the Athletics. Let’s start with the Prospect Batter: Sean Murphy

Murphy is a 24 year old power hitter who only strikes out every 5.4 at bats. Speaking of the above mentioned potential power that comes with age, Murphy has a .850 OPS.

Finally the Athletics Prospect Pitcher I selected was mlb.com No.1 ranked prospect Jesus Luzardo. I invite you to go on mlb.com and check out why Luzardo is No. 1 along with the prospects for your home team.",1

"In 2015 Cain had a WAR of 7.2 In 2017 he had a WAR of 2015. Reviewing his stats below, it looks like the seasons were pretty comparable. In 2015 he had less games, less hits, 7 more doubles, 1 more triple/HR, 13 more RBIs, so-on... Just eyeballing these stats without knowing a lot about WAR, it seems like the seasons aren't different enough to warrant the value of 2 additional wins on the 2015 season.

So I don't know a ton about baseball so sorry if this is a stupid question.  I've heard both that a pitcher needs more than one pitch to mix seems up so that a batter doesnt know what is coming.

One thing I've always wondered is about Baseball Prospectus' own advanced stats.

"I'm working on a side project using Baseball Prospectus' [Park Factors](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/index.php?cid=1819112), which give separate values for LHB vs. RHB.

My question is: Do heavy or extreme opposite field hitters exhibit reverse park effects? In other words, when using these L/R split park factors to predict future results, should I treat a LHB with high Oppo% as if they were a RHB and apply the RHB park factor, and vice versa?

It makes sense in my head because:

1. The average hitter pulls balls at a higher % rate than going opposite field or even center.

2. The direction the ball is batted in determines which geometrical features of the park the batted ball interacts with.

3. The geometry of the ballpark is what causes park effects.

"For position players, I've noticed that there seem to be a pretty close correlation. fWAR tends to produce a lower total number, but that seems to go league wide in my experience.

One issue I have with fWAR however, is how it seems to undervalue pitchers who generate outs by using weak contact. Marcus Stroman of the Toronto Blue Jays is a great example. On baseball reference he is currently sitting at 4 WAR, and is on pace for around 7.5. That's a number that usually has you in the cy-young conversation.

On fangraphs he is at 1.9 WAR. Not a terrible number, but no where near how valuable baseball reference thinks he is. This is a drastic shift, and makes me wonder what stat people think is better, especially for pitching.

I prefer rWAR because I think it's a mistake to use FIP instead of runs allowed. FIP assumes all contact is random, and fairly equally split between soft, medium, and hard. Runs allowed gives us a better reflection on what is actually happening out on the field. That's my opinion anyway.

If bases are loaded in the bottom of the 9th in a tied game and the batter gets a base hit in deep center, the game ends as soon as the runner on third crosses home plate.

"Okay so I've been working on this individual hitting/pitching baseball statistic since last Summer and I would like to get your opinions on this. Using coefficients from Tango Tiger's ""Run Expectancy Matrix"" that is used for the RE24 and REW statistics, I created a stat that would show the probability that a specific batter will earn his team a run (completely independent, so RBI's aren't included) during his at bat, with base running factored in. The arithmetic certainly looks a little messy, but if you really try to understand it, it can become clear:

((xa + yb + zc)1B + (xd + ye + zf)2B + (xg + yb + zc) 3B+ HR + (xa + yb + zc)BB + ((xd + ye + zf) - (xa + yb + zc))SB -(xa + yb + zc)CS)/(AB + BB)

Baseball Terms: 1B = Singles, 2B = Doubles, 3B = Triples, 
HR = Home Runs, BB = Base on Balls, SB = Stolen Bases, 
CS = Caught Stealing, AB = At Bats
Coefficients: x = .346, y = .332, z = .323, a = .416, b = .265, 
c = .127, d = .614, e = .397, f = .216, g = .843, h = .660,
 i = .247

For convenience, I will be using the acronym IREPA (Independent Runs Earned per At Bat) to define the stat. To test the effectiveness of IREPA, I took a teams total IREPA, then I subtracted the total IREPA that was achieved by opposing teams against them throughout the 2017 season, creating a net IREPA. I then did a linear regression test of teams' total IREPA and team Wins. This yielded a very good R value, .91, which is very similar to regression tests with WAR and WAA against Wins. I would like to do similar regression tests for previous years but as a college student that is too time consuming and I haven't gotten around to it yet. This stat can be used for both batters (IREPA) and pitchers (IREPA Against) but it wouldn't be as useful for pitchers because it is not defense independent. But then again, neither is ERA or WHIP. My goal for this was to create a stat that is easier to understand then WAR, which can be very difficult stat to be understood by casual fans, and make it more accurate then most mainstream stats(RBI, HR, AVG, OBP, SLG) which have big holes in them from an analysis standpoint. Please let me know what you guys think. Thank You!

"Rabbit hole...

Looking at 2018 potential HOF candidates on BBRef. Saw [Guillermo Mota](http://www.theonion.com/article/mets-acquire-guillermo-mota-from-indians-in-daring-5396) on the list, and noticed he was the 15,047th player to debut. Wondered who the 15,000th player was. (I'm assuming here that the BBRef count of MLB debuts is correct.) Saw that it had to be a player who debuted on [Opening Day* (April 5) 1999](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=1999&amp;month=04&amp;day=5). Except for Williamson (14,999), they're all listed as player #15,000. Here are the candidates: 


Jesse Garcia (BAL) - defensive replacement in 8th inning

Luis Garcia (DET) - defensive replacement in 8th inning

Brett Hinchliffe (SEA) - pitched 6th-9th innings

Masao Kida (DET) - came on to pitch in 8th inning

Onan Masaoka (LAD) -  pitched 7th inning

Kevin McGlinchy (ATL) - came on to pitch in with two out in 7th

Warren Morris (PIT) - started at 2B

Jason Phillips (PIT) - came on to pitch 6th inning (it wasn't good)

Scott Sauerbeck (PIT) - relieved Phillips in 6th inning 

Scott Williamson (CIN) - pitched 9th inning


*there was one game (in Mexico) on April 4, but no new players debuted.


BBRef lists all the games in ET, but I doubt that's correct, as it has the Dodgers playing in LA at 1:14 pm ET, or 10:14 am local time. So I adjusted the start times given (all times ET for comparison):

SF @ CIN: 2:06 pm

DET @ TEX: 2:35 pm

TB @ BAL: 3:10 pm

PHI @ ATL: 4:10 pm

ARI @ LAD: 4:14 pm

MON @ PIT: 7:06 pm

CHW @ SEA: 10:44 pm


Based on this, and how many runs were score in each game, I would guess that Williamson, Luis Garcia, and Masao Kida all entered their games around 5:00 pm ET. Which is to say I'm no closer to figuring out who the actual 15,000th MLB player was.

"According to [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/wrc/), wRC+ is calculated by taking a bunch of stuff (it's all in the link) and dividing it by League wRC divided by PA.  

All well and good. However, wRC is calculated by ((wOBA-lgwOBA)/wOBA Scale)+ League Runs/PA*PA.  If we're doing this for the whole league, doesn't this just reduce to League Runs?

"I'm trying to extend Nate Silver's [baseball ELO predictions](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-mlb-predictions/) to the league of legends world finals. It's simple enough to calculate the elo of each team, and then use those ratings to project how the tournament will go. 

The problem is that most games are regional, and not all games are taken equally seriously. 


Here's the way a season works: Each of the 4 main regions--North America (NA), Europe (EU), Korea (KR) and China (CN)-- have a spring split and a summer split. There's a mid-season invitational tournament to the top two teams in each region between the spring split and summer split. Then there's the world finals. Each split has it's own playoffs as well. Most people agree that KR is the best region by a good margin, but the rest of the rankings are a little muddier (with CN seeming a bit ahead of the other two). Most people also agree that the world finals is the tournament taken most seriously by the players, and the  mid-season tournament is taken the least seriously. However, the rest of the games are a little unclear. So how do I account for regional strength given that there's not as much data for international play (particularly at the low or mid levels)?


Option 1: I assign every team an elo of 1500 at the start of season 1 and see how the ratings pan out. This has a nice bonus of being simple. However last season, one of the NA teams really beat up on all the local competition and so the elo system thought it was one of the best teams in the world. But since the level of competition in NA is so much lower, the team got knocked out early on. 

Option 2: Use the international play to create the baseline for regional elo. With this method, I first look at international play looking only at the regions. Then after we see the ratings for the average world finals team from each region, I use that to handicap the baselines for last seasons spring and summer splits. This has the advantage of accounting for the fact that some regions are stronger than others, but it mostly accounts for the best of each region, not the worst of each region. That will confuse the spring and summer split stats. 


Option 3: I use a different K parameter for each of spring split, mid-season tournament, summer split, and worlds. I select each K based on what turned out to be the most predictive for last years world finals. I'm leaning towards this but it still requires that I assume that all teams were created equal at the start of season 1 which I think is not a reasonable assumption


I'd appreciate any insight the sabermetric community might have for this. Let me know what you think!",1

"I'm interested in looking at players' RBI as a percentage of the *total possible* RBI they could have had. For example, if a hitter came up three times with the bases empty in a game and then a fourth time with the bases loaded, he would have a total potential RBI of 7 (himself four times, and the three runners on when he came up with the bases loaded).

The thing is, I'm having trouble finding any of the data you would need to do this without combing through game logs en masse. You could do some rough calculations if you had LOB numbers for an entire season, adding in the player's RBI and number of plate appearances and subtracting the number of home runs. But this wouldn't account for runners on who were moved over but didn't score, and I also can't find LOB numbers for individual players across entire seasons.

Does anyone have ideas where I can find the data you would need to put this statistic together? Thanks in advance!",1

A friend and I have developed ZEF (Zone Effectiveness Factor), which aims to measure a pitcher's overall effectiveness by areas of the strike zone - whether they be a single area of the zone, or a third, or a quadrant, or the corners, etc.

"**What is DingerDB?**  
DingerDB is a database populated with MLB data including data points such as players, venues, umpires, games, and even down to each pitch for each game for years 2008 until current day.  (Note that currently 2008 is the earliest data we’ve acquired, but more will be pulled when we have time).  The frontend is an Apache open source data analysis tool called Superset which allows for real time querying of the data along with dashboards that can visualize data.  We have automated the pulling and parsing of data so DingerDB will always remain up to date.

[Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset)

**What is the purpose?**  
- We had the inspiration from retrosheets and the lahman database to try and make something that included current data that had much more granularity than both of those that included modern data such as pitchfx.  We also thought it would be interesting to try and figure out any correlations derived from the verbose data.

**Who we are?**  
- We are a few software engineers who enjoy baseball and have some experience with data processing and indexing so it seemed like a good idea for a side project.  With that said, if there are any features that are requested we will try to accommodate them as best we can if they are possible and our schedules allow for it.

**What do we want?**  
We would like to open DingerDB to a relatively small group of users and collect feedback on performance and usability.

**How do I get access to the data?**  
Post here or just DM us and we will PM your username/password

"I apologize if this has been asked before, but I searched and couldn't find anything related. I know that WPA is based on the change in Win Expectancy from one event to the next. What I can't find anywhere is whether errors are essentially considered to be the same as hits, or whether WPA is calculated as if the error hadn't occurred.

Imagine the bases are loaded with one out in the bottom of the 9th of a 2-1 game, and the batter hits a should-be DP grounder to short, but the shortstop overthrows the second baseman and two runs score. Does the batter get a WPA boost because the Win Expectancy for his team shot up to 100%?

"Ever wonder just how many more home runs heavier players hit than skinnier players? Probably not, but I decided to look at it further.

**Sample**: I included all qualified hitter seasons from 1990 to 2015. 

**Method**: I was interested in home runs as a measure of ""pure power""; as a result, I controlled for the possibility that players who are ""good hitters"" (i.e. higher batter averages) will tend to hit more home runs than those who do not (that is, I did not want to penalize a player for not being good at making contact). As a result, I calculated each player's home runs per hits, instead of something like home runs per AB.

**Results**:
Assuming approximately a league average BA (.265) for each hitter, I found that **each pound is associated with an increase of .21 home runs per season**  (the 95% confidence interval is .195-.224). For example, a 180 pounder is expected to hit 16 home runs per year, while a 220 pounder is at 24 home runs per year.

Some of the data were not valid. For instance, it was almost impossible to figure out the best pound-for-pound individual seasons, because they were dominated by *formerly* skinny players (whose listed weights remained the same across their career, in the Lahman database) who became huge, e.g. Barry Bonds (listed at 185 pounds), Sammy Sosa (165 pounds!), and Brady Anderson (170 pounds). It was quite humorous checking out pictures from players' specific seasons via Google Images. Sorry, 2004 Jose Valentin...you were not 175 pounds.


With that said, here are the pound-for-pound best seasons, filtered to the best of my ability:

**2010 Jose Bautista**: 37 HR over expected (205 pounds; 683 PA; .260 BA; 54 HR)

**1993 Phil Plantier**: 34 HR over expected (175 pounds; 536 PA; .240 BA; 34 HR)

**2009 Carlos Pena**: 33 HR over expected (225 pounds; 570 PA; .227 BA; 39 HR)


And, the worst...

**1998 Dmitri Young**: 27 HR under expected (295 pounds; 590 PA; .310 BA; 14 HR)
**2007 Dmitri Young** came in second place.

**2012 Carlos Lee**: 25 HR under expected (270 pounds; 615 PA; .264 BA; 9 HR)

**2002 Juan Uribe**: 23 HR under expected (245 pounds; 618 PA; .240 BA; 6 HR)

"These are both park- and league- adjusted rate stats that are intended to reflect total offensive contribution for batters per PA. Neither one includes baserunning.

But which is better and why?

It's strange that they view the Boston Red Sox offense so differently. [By wRC+](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2016&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2016&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=16,d), the Red Sox are far and away the #1 offense. But [by Tav](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/sortable/index.php?cid=1921660), they are #5, and not particularly close to the top.

They also have fairly wide differences in their measures of the Padres, Braves, Dodgers and Orioles, among others. For the Dodgers, TAv says they are clearly an above-average offense (11th in MLB), whereas wRC+ says they are clearly a below-average offense  (22nd in MLB). How can the two most highly-regarded all-up offensive rate stats be so far apart? And what does it all mean?

Here's grist for the conversation:

From [Baseball Prospectus glossary](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=tav):

&gt; True Average (TAv) is a measure of total offensive value scaled to batting average. Adjustments are made for park and league quality, as such the league-average mark is constant at .260.

&gt; True Average incorporates aspects that other linear weights-based metrics ignore. Reaching base on an error and situational hitting are included; meanwhile, strikeouts and bunts are treated as slightly more and less damaging outs than normal. The baseline for an average player is not meant to portray what a typical player has done, but rather what a typical player would do if given similar opportunities. That means adjustments made for parks and league quality. True Average's adjustments go beyond applying a blanket modifier-players who play more home games than road games will see that reflected in their adjustments. Unlike its predecessor, Equivalent Average, True Average does not consider baserunning or basestealing.


From [Fangraphs glossary](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/what-is-wrc/):

&gt; As you may have noticed, there’s now an extra column in the “Advanced” section for batting stats called “wRC+”. You can think of this stat as a wOBA based version of OPS+. It’s park and league adjusted and it’s on a very similar scale as OPS+. The difference is that it uses wRC, which is based on wOBA.

&gt; For those of you not familiar with the scale, 100 is average. Anything higher is above average and anything below 100 is below average.

&gt; Big thanks goes out to Tangotiger for pointing out how easy it was to implement this particular stat. It’s now available in all the player pages for major league and minor league players going all the way back to 1871. Please note that it is not park adjusted for minor league stats, but it is league adjusted.

&gt; Update: I’ve removed pitchers from the league baselines...

"Hi all,

I asked this in /r/baseball before I knew /r/Sabermetrics existed, but didn't get many replies. Does anyone know of a source for player projections that dates back to 1996ish? 

I found the [Baseball Projection Project](http://www.bbprojectionproject.com/), and chose the MARCEL projections because they go back far enough. However, they don't have WAR so I went through the painstaking effort of merging the data with some baseball-reference scraping and calculating WAR on my own. 

But, I neglected to check the data before doing so, and upon testing my projection against actual WAR, I found that the MARCELs were quite optimistic (in some cases, projecting strong seasons for players that ended up retiring!). My own simple MARCEL, just taking the last 3 years of WAR and weighting them, performed much better.

I love the Steamer projections -- they're exactly what I need, because they project rookie players as well, but they were built recently (I only could find the last 5 seasons).

Does anyone know of a reliable source for projections dating back to the late 90s/early 2000s? I've already written all the code, so even if it's not in WAR-format, I can probably calculate it.

Edit: I should mention, my version of WAR doesn't include fielding runs or advanced baserunning, just batting runs, wSB, and the positional adjustment. So I'd only need:  PA, AB, 1B, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, CS, BB, SO, IBB, HBP, SF, GIDP.",1

"Hi Everyone,
For the final project in my Applied Statistics Master's Degree Program I had an idea to test how ""The Books Out"" Effect on MLB rookie hitting can predict career longevity.
By ""The Books Out"" I am referring to the fact that a rookie can have an advantage in their first handful of games before the opposition can determine what their strengths and weaknesses are.  After these are determined the rookie is then, usually, at a disadvantage.
I was hoping I could get some pointers on the best way to do this from the Sabermetrics community.
My initial idea was to take the difference of a handful of offensive stats (BA, SO/AB, BB/AB, OBP, SLG, etc.) when ""The Books Out"" from when it is not.
Career longevity will be determined by career ABs.
I was thinking that the 2006 rookie class would be a good year to start since I would then have 9 post rookie years to determine longevity.
On to my questions...
How many ABs would you say it takes for teams to ""write the book"" on a batter?  100?  150?  More?  Less?
What statistics should I focus on to compare pre-""Book"" to post-""Book""?
Where is the best place to gather these stats?  I just came up with this project idea this morning so I haven't done too much digging.  I see that Baseball-Databank.org and Baseball-Reference.com both look like good resources, but I am going to need one that can filter the player rookie stats by pre-""Book"" ABs vs. post-""Book"" ABs.

According to FIP and Sabermetrics, though, he hasn't done anything wrong, since the balls in play are all on luck and the fielders. So if the manager pulls the pitcher, is he wrong?

Here's the catch: I'm not sure where to get started. I have a background in particle physics, giving me a basic knowledge of MC and statistics but I'm not sure which stats are important to the model building or how they should be described (are hits/RBIs or whatever poisson distributed?). Is there any existing codes or something that might help me get started as a basis?

"Hello everyone. I was trying to come up with a topic for my bachelor's thesis and while doing some research I found sabermetrics appears as a perfect candidate for my topic.  
Here is why I am asking for help. I study mathematics at the faculty of mechanical engineering. So it isn't pure Maths, but 75% Maths and 25% engineering. I chose department of statistics at our mathematical institute, so obviously my thesis has to be related to the chosen department. I just started statistics course this semester and I have another course in the next semester, so this part of Maths is new to me, but I am a quick learner so I don't really care.  
My question is - is it possible, how to put this, write a thesis about sabermetrics, but at the same time somehow satisfy requirements from my professor?  Would you be able to post some statistical methods or tools used in sabermetrics, which should help me show the mathematical part of the thesis?  
NOTE: Sabermetrics and Statistics is new to me and I wanted to know a opinion from people who understand it before doing further research, so I apologize if this question is stupid, I got this hype and trying to solve this ASAP.",1

I am making a pitch type classification model using a multinomial logistic regression model, plugging in predictor variables such as speed, movement, etc. However, since some of the variables are probably correlated with each other (e.g., inverse relationship b/w movement and speed), I'd like to adjust for that in my model. How would I go about doing that when I am training the model?

Also, in what scenario would I be using second-order variables (squaring the predictor)?

I am using R (nnet package, and probably caret for cross validation) for all this. Any feedback would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",1

So far, I am able to gather that in terms of predictive power/consistency (i.e., pitcher's true talent), cFIP is far superior, followed by SIERA, xFIP, and FIP. However, the list is reversed in terms of descriptive power (i.e., pitcher's ""true value""). I know DRA is somewhere where xFIP is on the lists.

Is my summary accurate for the most part? Please, if you have any feedback or insight, comment below! Thank you!",1

If a player has say a .375 BABIP, rather than putting it against his career average or a league average, would it not be possible to use Statcast data to determine exactly what his BABIP should be based on similar balls in play according to launch angle and exit velo and their expected BA?

For example, if this player has a BABIP of .375 and has put seven balls in play that have corresponding expected BAs, according to similar balls in play based on launch angle and exit velo, of say; .040, .090, .255, .260, .333, .560, and .850.

"I'm a baseball guy working on a soccer project. I'm trying to translate ERA- and PF to soccer statistics, but I'm running into an odd calculation problem.

I'm using a customized baseball park factor as a soccer league factor to compare players across two leagues, and a customized ERA- stat for a soccer rate stat (i.e. percentage) for the player and league average in the calculation. See the variables below:

w = Player A Rate: 52.38%
x = League A Average Rate: 33.32%
y = League B Average Rate: 14.42%
z = League Factor: 230

According to [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/era-fip-xfip/), the formula for ERA- is:
100 * ((w + (w – w*(z/100)))/ x)

Since a better ERA is a lower stat, and a lower ERA- indicates a better ERA relative to league average, Player A's anticipated ERA- should be exceedingly high since its above the League A average and the League B average adjusted for the League Factor. However, the final calculation is -47.29. Is this just a flaw in the stat when the League/Park Factor gets so big that the subtracted product of (w*(z/100)) is larger than (2w)? Or am I doing something wrong?

This is the only stat in the only league where this is a problem, out of 14 leagues and 35 stats. The other league factors all range (much more reasonably) between 60 and 134, and don't experience this problem.

I finally got around and started brainstroming about the structure about my thesis. My main focus is to use mathematical tools adequate to a college Maths student and make the baseball part easily understandable to people, who have little knowledge about Sabermetrics.  
My idea is to create a simple win prediction model, which is dependent only on runs scored and runs allowed. Here is how I would like to proceed:  
1. Predict runs scored using Markov chains inspired by ""A Markov chain approach to baseball"" by Bukiet, Harold, Palacios.  
2. Predict runs allowed by using team ERA. Here I am not sure how to predict it correctly. Any ideas?  
3. Use Pythagorean formula to predict number of wins or W%.  
4. Compare it with Linear regression model published in the Fall 2014 Baseball Research Journal [link] (http://sabr.org/research/new-formula-predict-teams-winning-percentage) or with my own created model.  
My biggest problem now is how to predict ERA, which statistical approach should I choose? Otherwise, as you can see, I am trying to use as few baseball statistics as possible, because I am afraid it may discourage not interested readers in further reading.

I am really sorry to be posting another kind of off topic here(it is the last one, I swear), but this time I have a specific idea how I would like to write my paper. Because my professor responded nearly after a week since I first wrote to him, I took the time and did a course on edX.org Sabermetrics 101. So i had a chance to have a peek into certain parts of Sabermetrics, even as brief as they were.  
The part which appeared the most interesting to me was about win predicting, win estimators, run differentials, runs to wins, etc. And my idea is to use data from our national league and:  
1. Try to explain why this season ended up the it did. Do a kind of post-prediction, create my own prediction, acting like I don't know the results and then compare my predictions with the real season ending.  
2. Do a prediction for year 2017.  
  
Few notes: Our national league has got 8 teams and the first league 10. So I would probably take all 18 teams and then draw a line under the 8th team. I don't want to deal with playoffs or playouts, just standard season.  
The main problem I see in my idea is number of games played. There are 35 rounds in National league and 18-30 (each year it is different) in the first league, which compared to MBL is awful low number. I am not sure this will be enough to get a solid result. If the number of games should not be sufficient I would return my research to MLB, I guess it wouldn't make such a difference for me.

"Hello there, as an amateur Sabermetics fan I wanted to get a little deeper into the area and figured what better way to do it than analyze the crap out of my adult slow pitch softball team?  

Last season (24 games) we had a friend keep track of our stats using the Game Changer app.  I wanted to try and use the data to figure out the ""perfect"" line up and was wondering if there was a way to test each line up?

I've looked around but wasn't able to find a decent line up simulator on line anywhere.  Any one by chance know of any out there?  Or perhaps just curious at looking at my data and offer a few tips for setting the line up?  Thanks!",1

Red=lm(y2~x4,data=color)

Blue would come out with a mean of 17 with a standard Error of 0.72,0.33, and 0.46 Red would come out with 1.2 with a standard Error of 0.11

What I want to end up doing is multiplying Blue and Red together but im not sure how to get the new standard Error. So with this example it would be the 17*1.2= 20.4 with a standard error of ? Maybe there is a better way to go about this?  Anyways like I said im kinda stuck so any help would be great

"New to sabermetrics; please forgive me if this answer is obvious or if I missed a response in my search. I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction.

While I appreciate that batting average is not the best indication of a player's worth, is there a formula somewhere to calculate a player's value based on batting average alone? In other words, what is x points (say, 1 point, 10 points, or 25 points or something) of batting average worth - in runs, wins, RBI, dollars, whatever?

Can we say, for example, that a player hitting .310 is worth 20 runs, 4 wins, 18 RBIs, and $800k/season MORE than another player hitting .285?

Is this even quantifiable for some or all of these stats - or a better one like WAR?

"I'm doing an independent project where I examine teams with success in the playoffs and compare the WAR for each player on their roster by position. I.E. Do teams with playoff success tend to have better catchers or shortstops? Is it better to spend money on a starting rotation or a bullpen if you want to succeed in the playoffs.

The problem I'm running into is that I can't systematically tell what player on the roster played what position. I used fangraphs for WAR data, but when I sort by position it looks like players playing less than about 110 games at a given position are excluded. I.E. Brian McCann of the yankees doesn't show up as a catcher even though he played 92 games there this year.

"I'm a big fan of wOBA and the improvements it makes on traditional stats by factoring in the relative run value of different types of hits. I was wondering if there was a similar statistic that measures a player's offensive production with runners on base, and similarly makes those adjustments based on where runners are on base. Hitting a double with someone on first could easily score that runner, while hitting a single may not.

In general I am not a fan of ""high leverage"" type statistics just because the sample sizes can be so small that the stats are near meaningless. I haven't seen any good proof that someone who is ""clutch"" one year will repeat that over time. And I'm more interested in using stats to predict performance, rather than using it for purely reporting purposes. But if we expand the high-leverage idea to encompass every scenario where a batter comes up with runners on any base, then the sample size may grow big enough to be useful. Anyone know of work like this?",1

"EDIT--title isn't quite correct. For very good pitchers, a high BABIP can cause an overly optimistic FIP, while for poor pitchers, a low BABIP can cause an overly optimistic FIP.



As you may know, the formula for FIP is:

* **FIP**= ((13(HR)+3(BB+HBP)-2(K))/IP) + FIP constant


xFIP is essentially the same, except the HR total is calculated by looking at the pitcher's FB rate and the league average HR/FB%.


Obviously, what these metrics do is estimate a pitcher's performance based solely on Ks, BBs, and HR--that is, they essentially eliminate any consideration of hits and balls in play, in an effort to eliminate random variance in ERA due to luck on balls in play. By eliminating these factors from consideration and instead focusing solely on non-ball-in-play outcomes, FIP and xFIP assume a pitcher will allow a league average BABIP.


This makes sense: When it comes to pitchers, we know that a good portion of the variation in BABIP is due to luck. And conversely, variation in Ks and BBs is purely a product of a pitcher's relative ability. 


Or is it? Obviously, a pitcher's skill is the biggest cause of K and BB variation, but if a pitcher doesn't face any batters, he can't strike anyone out or walk anyone! To illustrate, consider the following example:


* Pitcher A has been unlucky -- he's given up a .350 BABIP across 118.2 in innings while striking out 125, walking 25, and giving up 10 HR


* Pitcher B, on the other hand, has been lucky -- he's given up only a .250 BABIP across 126.2 innings while also striking out 125, walking 25, and giving up 10 HR


Now, assuming (solely for simplicity's sake; it doesn't affect the analysis) that neither of these pitchers have gotten any outs by drawing double plays or catching stealers or pickoffs, etc, they've each faced exactly 500 batters. Accordingly, they both have identical 25% K-rates and 5% BB-rates. 


Essentially, the only difference between these two pitchers is their batted ball luck. But FIP eliminates batted ball luck from its evaluation of a pitcher, so these guys should have identical FIPs, right? Actually, wrong. Here, pitcher A--the one who had the extremely high BABIP--has a 2.72 FIP. Pitcher B , who had a .250 BABIP, has a 2.74 FIP.


Now, I know these differences in my hypothetical are basically negligible, but the point remains the same--using raw K and BB numbers can skew value between guys with high and low BABIPs. This is even more troublesome given the fact that when 2 pitchers have a 100 point gap in their BABIP through 100+ innings each, we can probably assume that *some* portion of that gap isn't mere luck. But, as demonstrated, FIP can actually place *positive* value on a high BABIP. 



As for the smallness of the difference in my hypo, I'll point out that I just picked random easy numbers numbers without putting any thought whatsoever into the type of numbers that would better emphasize my point. As I crunched the numbers, I came to realize that, essentially, the better the pitcher (i.e. the higher his K%, the and lower his BB% and number of HR given up), and the more unlucky his BABIP (relative to a pitcher with identical FIP components), the bigger the difference would be. (Low HR and BB and high K makes the number added to the FIP constant more negative). This works in the opposite direction for non-top end pitchers (i.e., pitchers whose (13(HR)+3(BB)-2(K)) calculation is a positive).



So, all that said, why are we using raw K/BB numbers????",1
"Hi guys!

First time poster here, so let me know if this question is in the wrong place, or if there's a way I can find this info myself.

I'm wondering if there is a way to accurately compare a pitcher from the early 1900s to one in the modern era. You can compare WHIP or xFIP all day, but the dead-ball pitchers had a decided advantage thanks to not having to replace used baseballs, etc. Does anyone have a way to address this issue, or is the problem too multi-faceted and non-specific?

Basically, I want to compare Babe Ruth's pitching ability to those of modern pitchers.

I'm thinking that I could look at league-average xFIP (and other pitching stats) from 1915-1919 (Ruth's primary pitching years) and then do the same for pitchers in the modern era. Then I could say ""Ruth was in the top x percentile of pitchers in his era. The pitchers in in that percentile today are pitchers a b and c.""

Thanks for your help!

"Hope you guys don't mind something not 100% baseball, but how and to what degree do you think the linear weights would change?  In my league, a top team would have an OBP of approx .590, with 6% of ABs being HRs, 3% triples, 13% doubles, 2% of PAs are walks, 2% of PAs are sac flies.  A weak team team would have an OBP of .490, 2% HRs, 3% 3bs, 8% 2bs, 5% BBs, and I'm not sure about SAC flies (probably a lower rate).

I figure BBs+1bs will go up in value, 3bs+HRs will go down, and probably 2bs as well.  Do you agree, and how much of a difference should there be between the MLB values and the slow pitch ones.",1

"I was taking a look at some of the pitch f/x stuff on Fangraphs, and I'm wondering if there's anything to be learned from pitcher vs hitter matchups. For example, whether a ""fastball hitter"" has an advantage against ""fastball pitchers"". But I'm not sure the best way to look at it. Are there figures for what qualifies as a ""fastball pitcher""?

But even if a pitcher likes to throw his fastball a lot, if he's up against a fastball hitter, maybe he'll resort to other pitches instead? Maybe this changes depending on how good their own fastball actually is? Just kind of brainstorming here. But it seems like pitch selection may be dependent on both the pitcher's tendencies, pitch effectiveness, and hitter ability?

"For example, the White Sox. Chris Sale is wonderfully brilliant but there's not much of a team around him. 

If the Sox traded Sale for three pretty good starting pitchers and ran out of a rotation of Quintana-Samardzija-Good Pitcher-Good Pitcher-Good Pitcher, would they be better off than a rotation of Sale-(4 Dumpster Fires) if both rotations had the same average ERA? (And don't care about Shark or Quintana specifically just using an example)

I feel the Ace+Scrubs would be more valuable to a team with a poor offense because you're at least likely to win on Ace Day, while Five Guys rotation would be more valuable to a team with a high offense because you just need to keep it close enough for the offense to mash.

I'm not so schooled in the workings of playoff sports, so I may be way off here: but it seems like the validity of playoffs to determine the best team (assuming that is the goal)  implicitly relies on this assumption of transitivity. 

Team A beats Team B, Team B beats Team C, so we assume Team A can beat Team C?  (and his hence more deserving of a title). Even if we ignore the issue of close calls, where Team A beat Team B by getting some lucky plays in, it seems possible Team B might have some weaknesses that Team A was able to exploit which Team C might not have (i.e. it's possible Team C could beat A). 

Is this a problem that has been addressed empirically in playoff sports? Do we know that most of the time this assumption of transitivity is a good assumption?

"It's my understanding that things like FIP aim to show how well a pitcher *actually* performed by controlling for factors outside of their control. I also know that there are season-long projections on sites like Fangraphs that aim to project performance.

Kind of like ""so far in 2015 Kershaw has had a FIP of 2.82, and he's projected for a FIP of 2.41, so he's been performing at 85% of his expected output.""

The question comes to comparing stats like FIP or SIERA to projection models like ZiPS. ZiPS doesn't project SIERA. And in a way, that makes sense. Advanced stats aim to remove randomness and luck, so a projection can't accurately predict someone being unlucky. So in a way, projecting someone to be unlucky is kind of meaningless. In that case, is it valid to compare projected ERA and previous FIP?

But when looking at a player during, say, the past 3 days, is there a good way to figure out how ""locked in"" they are?

For example, a player could go 0-3, 2-3 (with a HR), and 0-3 on three consecutive nights, and still have a huge wRC+ for that period. Basically it gets inflated by a HR. Where as a player that goes 2-3, 1-3, 2-3 with all singles gets penalized because they're ""just"" singles, despite the fact that he would appear to be more ""locked in"".

"My question is multifacted and kind of convoluted because I'm just starting to toy with advanced metrics so if anyone needs any clarification please feel free to let me know..

So I'm currently looking at the 2014 season, my goal being to find out which players benefited the most from one aspect of their game (hitting, defense, baserunning). To this end I'm trying to figure out what percentage of their fWAR was made up of each component - for example, trying to isolate the player for whom their Wins Above Replacement was most prominently made up of Baserunning. 

What I've done is multiplied WAR by runs/win to get the raw sum (Baserunning+Batting+Fielding+Positional Adjustment+League Adjustment+Replacement Runs) and taken the percentages of baserunning, batting, and fielding. This would give me the percentage of the sum taken up by each component of WAR. 

This works well for the most part, but I do run into some issues that mess with the data - negative values, for example, which makes using percentages problematic because it's difficult to figure out what portion of a sum is contributed to by a negative value ([such as with Jean Segura here](http://i.gyazo.com/db547436ac93792c2d16f985d7ce0358.png)). If a player ends up with a negative WAR*(runs per win) value, or a value of &lt;1, then the percentages column just ends up with ridiculous numbers that I don't really know how to deal with.

Secondary question - my replacement runs column was taken from FanGraphs so I know it's good data but why is it that there are different values for each player? Shouldn't every Replacement Runs value for every shortstop be the same?

I get the sense that I'm approaching the problem the wrong way, and if I'm on the right track and there is a way to smooth out the kinks in my methodology then I sure would like to know.

"I just found this sub and this year is the first season I'm taking an interest in advanced stats and metrics, and I have a question. I've heard from many sources that, depending on the year/league, you come out ahead in run expectancy if you can successfully steal second in ~73% of attempts. This is based on the run-expectancy gain of moving the runner, versus the cost of an out. My question is does this include a term for the (low but not negligable) probability of the runner going 1^st to 3^rd on an error? If not, what is the 'true' break even point knowing that sometimes you'll be able to move to third (and make a huge RE gain).

I recently read ""The Book"", and I know they considered errors when discussing the value of a sac bunt attempt but I don't recall any mention of overthrows for SB attempts.",1
"exOUT%

In the early 21st century, Oakland Athletics’ General Manager Billy Beane revolutionized baseball forever. He was the first general manager in baseball to heavily utilize sabermetrics in his baseball operations. This isn’t a history lesson though, I bring him up because of his idea that outs are precious, and as a hitter your goal is to not make out, thus him prioritizing OBP so heavily. In the following years, baseball statistics have seen phenomenal progress on both offense and for pitchers. While I believe FIP and xFIP are both very useful statistics in really measuring a pitcher’s skill, my problem is that they essentially ignore all the batted ball data that we have (GB%, FB%, LD%). SIERA and tERA have solved some of these problems, but are far from perfect, and I believe the more statistics we have, the better. 

As I mentioned with Beane, while we largely focus on a hitter’s ability to not make out, we still don’t have a catch-all statistic to realize how effective pitchers are at getting batters, because if the batter’s goal is to not make out, the pitcher’s goal is to get the batter out. So I present to you expected out percentage, or exOUT% (the name is certainly a work in progress). exOUT% sets out to answer a simple question: For any plate appearance, what is the likelihood that the pitcher will get the batter out? This can easily be found by just looking at a pitcher’s opponent OBP, but that is rather primitive, and we can get a better estimate by focusing more on pitchers’ skills to strike people out, not walk batters, and the type of contact they are giving up, and also trying to negate the effect of the defense by him, by just using league averages. So to calculate a pitcher’s exOUT%, I used K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, FB%, lFFB%, and 2014 league averages on ground balls, line drives, and fly outs. (HBPs are essentially ignored but can certainly be incorporated in a future version, this is pretty exOUT% v .01)

 I want to give full disclosure, I am not a statistician or close to it. Math and statistics are an area of interest and I am currently pursuing a degree in math-economics, but I am far from a professional, so I recognize there are going to be errors in my data, this is an extremely rough version, there’s even a combination of data from this year and last year so there will be inconsistencies, as I don’t have the resources to gather all the data I need. If after reading this, you are interested in this and would like to take this further, please feel free to contact me if you have the skills necessary to advance this further (or even if you don’t). 

 I will first post a simple step-by-step breakdown of how to calculate exOUT%, and then get into more detail and take you through it with Clayton Kershaw, because well, he is awesome.

1- Add K% and BB%, subtract this percentage from 100%, this leaves you with a balls in play%, let’s just say BIP%

2- Multiply the pitchers GB% (make the percentage a number less than 1, for example 40% is .4) and BIP% (leave it between 1 and 100, ex 40%), this gives you a GB% for all PAs, not just balls in play, we’ll call this overall GB%, or oGB%… now multiply this percentage (in between 1 and 100) times the league average percentage of ground balls that don’t go for hits (league average is .239 on ground balls in 2014, so out percentage on ground balls is 76.1%, but make it .761…. this will give you a percentage you can leave between 1 and 100, if the number is 20%, that means that there’s a 20% chance that pitcher will induce a ground ball out that PA, assuming league average defense, we can assume this because we’re using the league average for batting average on groundballs… we’ll call this exgbOUT%

3- Now follow the same steps but with LD%, exldOUT%, the percentage chance for any given PA that the pitcher will produce a line drive out. (the league average on line drives last season was .685 (!) so that means there is a 31.5% chance a line drive will result in an out)

4- Same thing with FB%, sort of, because we also want to incorporate IFFB%. So multiply a pitcher’s FB% by their IFFB%, this gives you the percentage of balls in play that the pitcher produces an infield fly ball (bipIFFB%). Multiply this percentage by their BIP% to get his overall percentage of PAs that result in an infield fly, and this will also be their exiffbOUT%, because any infield fly ball should be converted to an out, and if not, it’s to no fault of the picture, so we won’t punish him. Next subtract a pitcher’s IFFB% from 1 or 100, whatever, and this is their balls in play percentage of fly balls that are normal fly balls, to the outfield. Multiply this number by their BIP%, this gives you the overall normal FB% for a pitcher, not just balls in play. Multiply this number by .793 (the league average on fly balls in is .207, so there’s a 79.3% that a fly ball will result in an out). This number is the percentage chance that for any given PA, the pitcher will produce a fly ball out to the outfield. Add this exnfbOUT% (n for normal) and his exiffbOUT% and you have his exfbOUT%, the percentage that for any given PA, the pitcher will produce a flyball out, to the infield or outfield.

5- Add K% + exgbOUT + exldOUT + exfbOUT

6- You have your exOUT%

The terms are not that technical or scientific so I don’t confuse anyone, tried to simply a very complicated procedure as much as possible. To clarify and give you an example, let’s go through Clayton Kershaw

Kershaw profiles like this (I compiled this data on 8/21): 32.3 K%, 4.9 BB%, 52.8 GB%, 26 FB%, 11.8 IFFB%, 21.2 LD%. 

So let’s look at the balls that don’t go in play, strikeouts and walks. Add the two and balls not in play percentage is 37.2, 4.9% are walks and thus won’t be an out, and 32.3% are strikeouts so will be an out. Thus far, Kershaw’s exOUT% is 32.3 (of a possible 37.2 so far)

Now let’s look at the balls in play. People will usually say that a pitcher can’t control what happens when a ball is in play, but I vehemently disagree, the type of contact the pitcher gives up can’t be ignored and large effects what will happen to the ball in play. I will quote a fangraphs article here to explain it, “Generally speaking, line drives go for hits most often, ground balls go for hits more often than fly balls, and fly balls are more productive than ground balls when they do go for hits (i.e. extra base hits). Additionally, infield fly balls are essentially strikeouts and almost never result in hits or runner advancement.” And fangraphs also gives us this data from 2014.

GB: AVG- .239, ISO- .020, wOBA- .220

LD: AVG- .685, ISO- 190, wOBA- .684

FB: AVG- .207, ISO- .378, wOBA- .335

So this means that fly ball pitchers are most likely to get outs, although they may be less effective because when they don’t get outs, it’s more trouble than ground ball pitchers. But remember, this statistic is just finding the chance that the pitcher will get a hitter out.

Alright so let’s calculate Kershaw’s exgbOUT%, exldOUT%, and exfbOUT%, you can follow the numbers along with the steps I listed above. 

GB%- 52.8

62.8 x .528 = 33.1584

(33.1584 x .761)=  25.23354424 exgbOUT


LD%- 21.2

62.8 x .212 = 13.3136

(13.3136 x .315) = 4.193784 exldOUT


FB%- 26

26 x .118= 3.068 bipIFFB%

26 x .882= 22.932 (bipFB%) 

62.8 x .22932= 14.401296 (onFB%)

14.401296 x .791= 11.3914251 exnfbOUT%

62.8 x .03068= 1.926704 oIFFB% and exiffbOUT%

exnfbOUT% + exiffbOUT% = 13.3469317 exfbOUT%, if you followed my math exactly a decimal may be off, like 13.31 something, but this is the number the excel doc chugged out, so I’m trusting that, my iPhone calculator can’t carry all the decimals sometimes.

Now add them all up

32.3 + 25.23354424 + 4.193784 + 1.926704  + 11.3914251 = 75.07% 

K% + exgbOUT% +  exldOUT% + exiffbOUT% + exnfbOUT% = exOUT%

The league average exOUT%, using league average statistics from 2014 for the ones involved, is 69.8%. Scherzer leads the majors (well the 89 pitchers I was able to export data from fangraphs) with a 76.43 exOUT%, if you want to look at it as a more concise and better version of opponent OBP, his is .236, so, you know, good. Here is a picture of the data,(http://imgur.com/um42PkI)  for the top 37, the J column is what you are looking at, Betances is in their because I wanted to calculate one reliever. 

Alright, I’ve explained it a bit in the prologue, but now that you’ve seen it, let me explain more why I like this stat. Well first, I created it and calculated, so, well, yeah… but I also like this stat because it answers a very simple question “How good is a pitcher at getting people out?” Pitching in its simplest form, is exactly that, getting people out. The stat recognizes that there’s basically only these outcomes for an at bat: strikeout, walk, ground ball, line drive, fly out and looks at the pitcher’s stats in these categories to determine how many people he should be getting out. The stat is more predictive than evaluative in nature, because you can calculate a pitcher’s actual out percentage, but that doesn’t nearly tell the whole story, because a lot of luck is involved with balls in play, and other fluky outcomes. This operates under the basis that a ground ball will perform the way the average ground ball does, a line drive performs the way an average line drive does, and a fly ball behaves the way a typical fly ball does. There could be guys getting very fortunate with ground balls: having a great infield behind them, balls not squeaking through the holes; with line drives: being hit right at people; and fly balls: staying in the park, having outfielders who cover a lot of ground. And there could be guys who are getting unlucky: the ground balls are getting through the holes, the infielders don’t have range; line drives seem like they are always going for hits, and fly balls are falling in. This says that a pitcher can’t control that, but they can control how much they strike out people, how much they walk people, and how often they give up ground balls, line drives, and fly balls, and if these balls in play behaved the way they should, the pitcher should be getting this percentage of people out. 

I will address the flaws I have found with it. As much as getting people out is important, sometimes what happens in the plate appearances that don’t end in outs are almost as important. This only deals in average regarding balls in play, but wOBA is very important too. Fly balls are more likely to be outs than ground balls, but the wOBA on fly balls is over 100 points higher on fly balls too. Additionally, I’d prefer instead of ground balls, line drives, fly balls, to use soft contact, medium contact, hard contact, because that is a truer test of pitcher skill, however, I did not have this data at my disposal as far league averages on what the batting average is for soft contact, medium contact, hard contact (if someone does, please contact me like I said). So what I have for now will do and this batted ball data is still a good measure. I sat out to calculate what percentage of batters a pitcher should be getting out, and that is exactly what I found out. So while it’s not perfect, it has it’s use, and it’s something to build on

exRP27

And build on I did, while the out percentage is nice, it doesn’t give us a measure like ERA or FIP or xFIP, that tells us how many runs a pitcher should be giving up. So using the data I used to calculate exOUT%, I present to you exRP27 (expected runs per 27 outs, a stupid name for a hopefully not stupid stat). 

The basis for this stat is this data from fangraphs, “Line drives are death to pitchers, while ground balls are the best for a pitcher. In numerical terms, line drives produce 1.26 runs/out, fly balls produce 0.13 R/O, and ground balls produce only 0.05 R/O.” *(I don’t know how this was calculated, or when it is accurate for, but this is what I got). We don’t know this for soft contact, medium contact, hard contact, so again I’m sticking with ground balls, line drives, and fly balls. 

Alright so what I am going to do using this stat and the pitcher’s K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, and FB% is seeing how many runs the pitcher should be allowing over 27 outs, and then adjust it to get it on a scale similar to ERA, FIP, and xFIP. 

Keeping Clayton Kershaw as our example, let’s take a look

Kershaws K% is 32.3, we’re multiplying this by 27 (for outs in a game), and we get 8.721 K’s, so 0 runs so far because a K will never produce a run

Now GB%. His exgbOUT% is 25.23354424, multiply this by 27 and we get 6.8 (ish, final number will be exact via the excel doc). Multiply this by .05 (the runs per GB out he gets) and we get .34 runs.

LD%- his exldOUT% is 4.193784, multiply by 27 and get 1.13232168, and multiply this by 1.26 for LD runs/out and we get 1.43 runs

His exfbOUT% is 13.3181291, now multiply by 27 get 3.6 and then that by .13 and you get .47 runs

Add up all these exRUNS and Kershaw’s total is 2.24. However, we can’t stop here because the number of outs he’s recorded is only 20.3 (8.7+6.8+1.1+3.6) approximately. 20.3 is the rounded up total. So get this 20.3 (or whatever the pitcher’s exOUTS is) up to 27  by multiplying by whatever it takes, and then multiply his exRUNS by this same number. For Kershaw you end up with 2.97 exRP27unofficial. The league average would be 3.78. Last year’s average ERA/FIP/xFIP was 3.74, but when I adjust everything to that, everyone’s exRP27 just goes down slightly (Kershaw’s from 2.97 to 2.94), but I want it to be on a more realistic scale where everyone’s totals are lower and a really good exRP27 is comparable to a really good FIP, like in the low 2s. 

So I don’t what the statistics correct way is, but here is what I did to make it work. I calculated what his “ERA” would be using by multiplying his exRUNS by 9 and then dividing that by his exOUTS. His was .99, the league average was 1.26. I then did .99/1.26 to get .78 or so, I then multiplied that by his exRP27unofficial and got 2.34, I felt like this was more realistic and in line with his ERA/FIP/xFIP. Obviously, can’t be the same because they measure different things, but just got in in the area. And the same is done for all pitchers obviously, not everyone gets multiplied by .78 of course. 

Here is the leaderboard for that (S column), you will need to zoom in. http://imgur.com/1AvTDiG

I really like this stat a lot, and feel like it does what I wanted to accomplish, figure out how many runs a pitcher should allow per 27 outs given his K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, FB%, and the notion that balls in play will behave the way they normally, as anything else is likely luck and not indicative of the pitcher’s performance. 

I look at Sonny Gray as someone this stat is perfect for. His ERA is outstanding at 2.04, but his FIP is 3.00, his xFIP is 3.47 and his SIERA is 3.50. The problem is, at least with FIP and xFIP for sure is that they ignore what happens when the ball is in play. He doesn’t strike out too many people, he has a good BB% but not spectacular, and he’s given up 10 home runs, a fair amount, so this hurts his FIP and what not. However, instead of saying “well he will regress, look at his FIP/xFIP/SIERA” this looks at why he’s having this success, and it has to do with the balls in play, which is getting ignored. Gray’s LD% is just 14.6! That is really good! Second best of the 90 pitchers I did this for. And his GB% is 54%, 9th best, also really good. The pitcher does have control over the type of contact he allows, and the fact that Gray is producing a ton of ground balls, and very few line drives is why he’s been so successful. His 2.34 exRP27 suggests that he has not been as good as his 2.04 ERA suggests, but he’s not as far off as the other stats suggest. 

Obviously exRP27 is far from perfect, and is in no way supposed to replace FIP/xFIP/SIERA, but it is something to look at with them. I am a big believes in aggregation, so I think that averaging some combination of these 4 stats together or them all, is an even better way to evaluate a pitcher. We’ve got more data than ever, so it makes sense to use it, exRP27 and exOUT% are just more examples of utilizing this data to help better evaluate pitchers.  

I hope you guys enjoyed. Any feedback please comment or contact me. Next I will be looking at exWOBA against for pitchers using similar data, and exWOBA for batters using the data but for hitters.

------------

TL;DR

the first stat is exOUT%, or the probability that a pitcher, given league average defense and a random batter, will get the hitter out, using his K%, BB%, GB%, LD%, and FB%

The second stat is exRP27, basically parlays that data into an ERA like stat, or runs expected per 27 outs

"In r/videos - someone posted this video of an 18 pitch at bat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4JuBmzjNsE

Which got me thinking about the value of wearing out a pitcher. What is the value of this?

What would the value of someone who never got a hit, either always struck out or walked be? Let's say, a player always eventually struck out, but it took the pitcher X amount of pitches to strike the batter out. How big does X have to be for you to want this person on your team? 

Could you be considered the best batter in history if you never got a hit, but walked at a sufficiently high rate? How good would your walk rate/pitch count rate have to be before teams would intentionally walk you every time?

"Okay, amateur statistics guy here, and I was doing some number compiling here, and I put together some numbers, and I think my conclusion holds up. Tell me what you think:
 
The Toronto Blue Jays are sitting at 57-52 (for a .523 winning percentage), five games over .500, and in second place to the surprise Yankees in the AL East by four and a half games. They're by most accounts having a fine season, and their activity leading up to last week's non-waiver trade deadline definitely can't hurt their postseason outlook. (On a side note, they're currently at 69.1% odds to make the Postseason, 21.3% to win the division.)
 
The Oakland Athletics are a bit worse off: they sit at 48-61 (.444), a whopping thirteen games under .500, and sit in the cellar of the AL West just behind the Seattle Mariners (a team I picked as a Wild Card team in Spring Training - oops) and 12 games out from the even-more-surprising-Houston Astros. The A's, by all accounts, are having a bummer of a season.
 
But I was compiling some statistics concerning runs scored and runs given up for the season (which is totally something a normal person does), and one thing stuck out at me: the Toronto Blue Jays and the Oakland Athletics are underperforming.
 
The Pythagorean Win Theorem is a creation of Bill James that relates the number of runs scored and runs allowed to a team's actual win percentage; this is based on the idea that a team's runs scored and runs allowed is a better indication of its future performance than its actual ""real"" win percentage is.
 
Before Wednesday's games, the Bluebirds from The Great White North have scored 578 runs while giving up 464 runs, for MLB's best run differential at 114. (Side Note Two: my St. Louis Cardinals are at #2, three runs behind at 110.) If you plug these numbers into James' Pythagorean theorem formula (using 1.81 as the exponent), it results in a Pythagorean Record of 65-44, a winning percentage of .596.
 
The Moneyballers, for their part, have scored 449 runs while giving up 417, for the Major's eleventh-best run differential of 32. If you plug these numbers into James' formula, again using 1.81 as the exponent, it yields a Pythagorean record of 58-51, a winning percentage of .532.
 
The Jays are eight games below what their Pythagorean record forecasts, the A's ten. For the record, no other team is more than five games off their Pythagorean win total, which pretty close to normal for this test. Through 2013, the average difference between the Actual and the Expected W-L is a bit more than 3 games at the end of a season, although there are exceptions (such as the 2005 and 2007 Arizona Diamondbacks, who beat their expected W-L by 11 games, as did the 2005 Baltimore Orioles).
 
Now, this isn't to say that the Blue Jays should be at 65 wins, or the A's should be at 58 wins. It's merely a rough estimate of what their ending winning percentage likely will be, given their runs scored vs runs allowed numbers stay where they are. They could suffer injuries in their rotations, or in their lineups, or the Coliseum could finally burn down, fall over, and sink into the San Leandro Bay, or any other number of big, bad things can happen. However, in the AL East, where the top four teams are separated by 5.5 games - and second through fourth by just a single game - eight wins can make a big difference. In the case of the AL West, the difference of 10 games puts the A's in second place - a mere two games out of the division-leading Astros. For fans of these teams, imagining where the teams might be - or could be in two months' time - can be maddening, especially for Oakland fans; the A's playoff odds currently sit at 0.6%.

This led me to wonder: why are these two teams so far under their expected W-L record? One culprit seems like it could be their records in one-run games. The Blue Jays have participated in 34 contests decided by a single run, with an 11-23 record, good for a .324 winning percentage. That’s horrendous, considering their .523 actual win percentage and their .596 Pythagorean win percentage. Just competing at their real percentage, their record would be 18-16, good for 7 of those 9 wins they’re missing, a record of 64-45, and a two and a half game lead in the division. Go by their Pythagorean win percentage, and you’re looking at a 20-14 record in one-run games, and a 65-43 record, and first place in the AL East by four and a half games.
 
The A’s have participated in 36 one-run games, and are a similarly abysmal 11-25, good for a .306 win percentage. Going by their .440 actual win percentage, and they would be 16-20 in one-run games. At 5 more wins, this isn’t earth-shattering, but it’s enough to get them to 53-56, 7 games out (and out of the cellar) of the AL West. Use their Pythagorean win percentage – .532 – and the A’s are at 19-15 in one-run games, good enough for a 56-53 record, only 4 games out of the division lead.",1

"Curious about matchups. I've been doing some reading, and I'm not sure what to make of it.

"Back again with another question, hopefully one worth doing our senior project about. After speaking to a couple college pitchers and one minor league, an idea that seemed to follow was looking to see if pitching at Coors field is actually affected by the high altitude.

 There are a few articles about the physics aspect, but no real stat heavy ones I've found. Basically we would be comparing the outcome of a pitch at Coors vs at some sea level stadium. Because based on the physics, the ball shouldn't break as much at high altitude, so hypothetically the same pitch could be thrown and end up being too high when it's usually a strike. A couple players mentioned you throw more sinker ball pitches in Colorado, so one think we would test is to see if there really is a higher frequency of these pitches being thrown.

Does this sound logical to anyone? Or worth investigating? I know it's probably not up to par with the usual saber metrics stuff but it is at least something we don't think has been done before, it was suggested by a player, and lastly it is kind of interesting.",1

"I am a total newbie to saber metrics and baseball analytics in general, although I do enjoy the sport. For a senior semester project, we are looking to do something relatively useful in analyzing baseball, particularly pitching. Hypothetically- could we formulate some metric that quantifies how many runs a pitcher should allow in a game? 

The true test of whatever model we made would be comparing our model to a real time matchup- for example we'd simulate a game where we know who pitched and who won. We would input who pitched for say the Rangers and get their predicted number of runs they allowed, and do the same for the second team of pitchers and whoever had a lower score would be the winner of the game.

This probably sounds incredibly rough and elementary but like I said, I'm a total newbie at this. I'm reading Analyzing baseball stats with R and just ordered ""The Book"" because we have yet to come up with a good idea for our project. Anyone have any insight on this mess of an idea, or suggestions for something interesting to look into?

"Hey y'all. We all know that defensive statistics are notoriously volatile in one year samples, and it's recommended that you use 3 years of data to form meaningful opinions on players. 

The problem with that is that WAR relies heavily on a 1 year sample of UZR, which leads to player's WAR being heavily influenced by these fluctuations. Might it be more accurate to calculate WAR with a 3 year rolling average of UZR in place of the 1 year UZR currently used? 

For example, say there is an imaginary player A that played from 1980-1990. Their 1985 WAR is currently calculated by 1985 oWAR+1985 dWAR. Might it be more accurate to say their 1985 WAR is 1985 oWAR+((1984 dWAR+1985 dWAR+1986 dWAR)/3)?

"Every one grab a seat because class is now in session

As a baseball fan all my life, I have never paid intense statistical-based attention to the game until this April. Now with my beloved Mets absolutely killing it on the field (LGM!!), I saw an intrinsic problem with announcer’s favorite old statistic: Runs per Game

While watching Wilmer Flores' walk off home run, I realized all the potential ways a game can end without both team getting 27 outs or getting even more (walk-off, extra innings, weather). The stat I present to fix this problem is Runs per 27 (R/27). It can more accurately calculate the true run production of a team when their performance is adjusted for a nine-inning game. Lets calculate R/27 for the Mets as of 11:59PM August 27 2015. Source for stats: http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2015-batting.shtml

R/27 = (Runs / Total Outs) * 27

R/27 = (520 / 3450) * 27

R/27 = (0.15072463768116) * 27

R/27 ≈ 4.07

This is a more accurate measure as it accounts for all the times there are more or less than 27 outs in a game (home game win, Walk-off, weather, etc.). I thank you for your patience on my first post and would love to hear your feed back on this idea and how to make it better!

The total offensive fWAR almost identical (10868.4 to 10826.3, NL getting the very slight edge.) I could be wrong, but I feel like the pitching fWAR should be that close as well. ",1

"So I found this post on /r/fantasybaseball 


https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/2v18ut/making_custom_projections/

which led me to these sources for making fantasy rankings: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/2v18ut/making_custom_projections/codp6fu

Which leads to now, when I just tried to use this method. What I found was that catchers end up getting ranked extremely high, even in only a 1 catcher 12 team league I was getting Posey ranked as a top 20 bat. 

The reason for this (if it wasn't already obvious), is that the value over replacement for catchers is extremely high, given that there aren't that many good catchers in the league. This causes severe inflation of the score for the catchers who are actually good. Is there maybe a better score to use than the Z-score? It feels unnatural adding a bunch of Z-scores together, but it has been a while since I took a statistics course. I'm not sure if anyone has any suggestions for pointing me towards a better method.

As a quick summary for what I did:
I calculated a Z-score for each of the 5 roto stats using a sample of hitters who have projected AB&gt;400. Then I added those Z-scores to get a single score, Z_UNADJ.
Next, I roughly calculated how many players from each position would be drafted in a 12 team league, and used this to get the value of a replacement player at that position. As an extreme example, in the case of catchers: For a 1 catcher league, the 13th ranked catcher had a Z_UNADJ of around -4.5, which means I added 4.5 to all catchers, giving them a huge boost in the rankings. For a 2 catcher league , the 25th ranked catcher had a Z_UNADJ of around -8.5! This caused Buster Posey to be ranked THIRD overall. What am I doing wrong here?

Is this a valid approach for ranking the value of players for a standard 5x5 roto draft?

"I'm relatively new to sabermetrics, but it appears that a staple is that ""clutch factor"" is probably negligible.

"I'm fairly new to all this, but I'm trying to create a predictions spreadsheet for daily fantasy and I'm trying to isolate the % impact of a pitcher's talent on a batter's average. 

The question I want to answer is: all else being equal, if a batter faces a particular pitcher, to what degree does his expected batting average against that pitcher vary from his usual expected  average based on the particular pitcher's talent. I would like to eventually have it so I can use his projected average and the pitcher's FIP to come up with a modified projected average for a single day against a single starter. 

Obviously the variability on any single day is going to be enormous, not to mention the issue of relief pitchers (I guess I could weight it 2/3rds to the starting pitcher's FIP and 1/3rd to the bullpen's combined, weighted FIP), but over the whole season I'm hoping it will be beneficial.

"I just have a question about the math in the preface of the paperback edition of the book published after the 2006 season. They're talking about whether or not the AL is better than the NL and they're using EqR and CPA in three different leagues (in this case the 2005 NL, the 2006 NL, and the 2006 AL) to determine the better league. I'm going to quote the book now because I think it will help answer the question I ask. 

&gt;*""All of the payers in both the 2005 NL and the 2006 NL combined for 61,322 CPA. These players produced .1868 EqR/out in the 2005 NL and .1779 CPA in the 2006 NL. The ratio here is 1.050
All of the players from the 20055 NL and the 2006 AL combined for 11,233 CPA. They produced .1787 EqR/out in the 2005 NL and .1588 EqR/out in the 2006 AL, for a ratio of1.125.
The ration of the ratios is (1.050/1.125), or 0.933. It suggests that the 2006 AL was about 7 percent harder to hit in than the 2006 NL""*

So my question is, how did they get 7 percent out of all of those number? And in my defense I have been terrible at math my entire life, so I might be missing something really obvious. It would be great for any help though because I would really like to understand this concept.

"So I was looking a bit more into Trout's UZR, and the -3 he has for his arm doesn't surprise me. What does is his Range score of -5, especially since his revised zone range is .913, only .003 behind the league average CF. When I look at his plays made out of his zone, he is ok, but not great. Inside edge says he has a couple of missed 90-100% plays, but besides that he's made 100% of his 60-90% and 40-60% plays. He has only had 3 opportunities though for 10-40% plays, making 2 out of 3, while the top CF tend to have over 10-15 attempts.

"Just got curious based off the NL MVP discussion on the value of a batter vs a pitcher and as I am not well versed on advanced statistics I figured I would ask you guys here. 

So I know most of the time WAR is brought up to value a player's worth based on their statistics for the entire season. But I was curious if there was a statistic to calculate a player's worth on a per game basis, particularly from a hitters perspective. 

For example (very basic not including OBP), A batter who goes 0-4 with two games in a row and then goes 4-4(with various xbh) in the third game. His average for the year would be .333 which I assume would provide a pretty good WAR. Throw in some HRs and doubles and he would be an MVP candidate. However his effect on 2 out of every 3 days would be a detriment to the team. So overall the hitter could be hurting his team more than helping, something that (as far as I know) is not presented in any statistics.",1

"It's no secret that teams are shifting more than ever this season as [they're on pace for over 13,000 shifts this season](http://baseballinfosolutions.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/shift-rates-on-the-rise/)*, up from last year's seemingly impossible record of [8,134. That means from 2011](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/anthony-castrovince-odd-defensive-alignments-the-new-norm?ymd=20140304&amp;content_id=68665254) to 2014 the rate of shifts has gone up over 450%!

Meanwhile UZR, fangraphs' defensive metric of choice and the sole source of their defensive component of WAR, has failed update with the times as [it still flatly ignores any play influenced by a defensive shift](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/anthony-castrovince-odd-defensive-alignments-the-new-norm?ymd=20140304&amp;content_id=68665254). Especially for UZR which relies so desperately on larger sample sizes, this seems absolutely unacceptable. Take a team like the Astros for example [who have been shifting more than anyone and with good results](http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2014/4/28/5650124/early-returns-on-the-shift): [UZR absolutely hates them estimating their defense as 31 runs below average](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2014&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2014&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ts&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=19,d) which is why the Astros find themselves with the far and away lowest position player WAR total of any team despite only the 19th worst offensive production. DRS, which while by no means perfect does acknowledge shifts, has those same Astros at -18, so it's not like the Astros are good defensively, but that still seems like too big of a gap.

How much do shifts affect UZR and fWAR? How big of a problem is it? What are the alternatives?

That would mean that the stats that have an impact on BABIP are LD%, GB%, FB%, IFFB%, IFH%, SB, Spd, UBR, and BsR - in other words the better you hit the ball and/or the faster you are, the higher BABIP you're likely to have.

"A couple interesting snippets from **[this fangraphs q and a with Dan Kantrovitz, St. Louis Cardinals Scouting Director](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/qa-dan-kantrovitz-st-louis-cardinals-scouting-director/)**. In my mind all mlb franchises have ridiculous off the field teams that get to use more advanced data than we could imagine getting our hands on. Really intrigued by what varying shifts are happening across the league with the priority of actual human being scouting relative to technology driven data analysis.

This dude is a super stud, Brown undergrad, Harvard masters in stats. And before this gig he was the director of international scouting for the A's from 2009-2011. Obviously doesn't give away any trade secrets, but it is interesting how from a young player/scouting standpoint they are definitely working with data that has more of a human element. Then dumping all that weirdly quantifiable data together with actual baseball statistics and popping out a run based metric.  

Kantrovitz giving us a pea of the tip of the iceberg. Deep down I want to believe that in the long run coaches, managers, front offices are all just a cog in this terminator-esque cyborg machine that achieves singularity. And then there is parity and everyone is happy. The end. *Edit: nevermind, true ending to that story would be dominance by the franchises that ""figured it out"" and $ spent but that isn't a pleasant image.* 

---------------------------------

**On methodology and valuation**

“When you talk about our methodology, it’s not rocket science. It’s more, ‘Find a reliable metric; see what’s worked in the past and use it as a guide going forward.’ As a scouting director, I need to be disciplined to implement it and sell it to our department of scouts, who might not always agree with what we think the optimal decision is.

“Basically, we translate every piece of available information into runs. We have data from scouts, doctors, trainers, quantitative analysts, specialists in pitching mechanics – they all provide an expert opinion on a player. We bake all those opinions together and apply discount rates to enable us to compare players apple to apples in today’s dollars. We basically end up with a present value for every player on our board.

“We try to keep it as scientific and data-driven as possible, but our metrics aren’t our end-all-be-all. Our scouts know that. Any time you’re dealing with amateur baseball players, it’s highly variable. If we didn’t allow some wiggle room — quite a bit of wiggle room in some cases – from the influence of our scouts’ voices, we’d be off.”

-------------------------------


**On communication and analytics**

We spend a lot of time and energy baking-in or combining things like performance data with scouting opinions. At times, it’s helpful to have a feel for how much our scouts need to “like” a player with, say, a poor performance track record, in order for him to be in our draft wheelhouse. Clearly, there are a lot of in-betweens that are not so clear cut or that aren’t so easily distinguishable, Having a background in analytics does help in making some of those judgement calls. But, look, I don’t think you have to have a masters in stats to do this job. I just think it helps in the way that I do this job.

“I don’t spend much time writing code anymore – I did quite a bit of that when I was in Oakland – but there is less time for me to do that in this role, and we have a few really talented guys in our office where programming is their primary responsibility. Guys like Matt Bayer, Dane Sorensen and Chris Correa have done some outstanding analytical work in support of our drafts over the past couple years. Every now and again I’ll delve into the data if I’m curious about something, but my responsibilities are more to interpret the data than to be a day-to-day doer of the data.”",1

"Hello /r/Sabermetrics , I am currently working on an MS in Economics and have decided to apply to change my degree to an MA with thesis, and I want to write my thesis on baseball in some regard. I have done a couple small-scale empirical studies in previous courses on things like winning games with respect to salary, but I really want to find as solid of a question to tackle as possible for a thesis paper. It will be a data-driven work, so anything measurable would be fair game to me. 

So far, I have been pondering the possibility of studying pitcher performance with respect to pitch count and inning, but I don't know if I could really narrow that down well enough.

It might sound like I'm asking for someone to ""do my work for me,"" but I figured I should see if there are any other ideas that anyone could suggest as far as questions that have yet to be answered.

Thank you for your time",1
"I mean, wouldn't ERA- be easier to calculate?",1
"How come, on Baseball-Reference, offensive WAR and defensive WAR don't add up to the total WAR? 

Here's an example: Look up Aaron Guiel on there. His career offensive WAR is 1.4, and his career defensive WAR is -0.4. I'm aware that BR does some rounding so that it's ""1.4"" and not, say, ""1.384742..."", so I'm aware that numbers can fluctuate a bit. 

That said, you then look at Guiel's career WAR, and it's 1.9. How do you add 1.4 and -0.4 and get 1.9? 

I subscribe to WAR as a tool, but stuff like this throws me off.",1

I operate on a Brian Kenny-esque evaluation scale; I'm completely fine with just using stats. My idea of true evaluation is essentially the antithesis to ""analysts"" like Harold Reynolds, who reject stats besides relatively unimportant ones like batting average. I'd assume most value both, but I'm not sure. How does everyone else evaluate a player?",1

"Hey, I'm trying to get back into baseball (I'm a Cubs fan so I haven't really cared much recently haha) and I'm confused by the seasonal adjustments that the sabermetric websites make.

I understand at a basic level how the game has changed through different eras, so WAR, as Wins Above Replacement, should be adjusted likewise (I wish Fangraphs and Baseball Reference would post WAR statistics that didn't have seasonal adjustments, though).

However, I don't understand why the constants that determine the linear weights for calculating wOBA should change every year.  Why would a single be more inherently valuable in one season compared to the next?  Why would a HR in 2013 be worth more than a HR hit in 2007?  A HR in each era is worth the same number of runs.",1

"Using Baseball Reference's Play Index, I wanted to see which team based statistics for the month of March/April were the best predictors of team performance in the month of May, using the following statistics for the years of 2009-2013:

* Win %
* Regressed Win % (Regressing 67 games to the mean)
* Pythagorean Expectation (Using RS and RA for April and custom ""Pythagenpat"" exponents for April)
* sOPS+ (As listed on Baseball Reference, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* FIP (Offensive and defensive versions, using the previous years FIP constant, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* wOBA (""Basic"" Speed offensive and defensive versions, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* Basic Baseruns (""Basic"" offensive and defensive versions, calculated as a pythagorean expectation and using the same custom exponents used for RS and RA pythagorean expectation)
* Technical Baseruns (A more technical version of above.)

Obviously, this analysis could be significantly improved (analyze more data, ""tune"" the various statistics more accurately, analyze more statistics, try different pythagorean exponents, etc.), however, I simply wanted to establish a starting point for future analysis. 

[Image of the results of correlation, r-squared, and MAE](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BldxLL0CcAAhvi6.png:large)

From the results I feel pretty confident in suggesting that sOPS+, FIP, wOBA, and Baseruns provide a much better projection for the next month of a teams performance than previous Win%, Regressed Win%, and Pythagorean Expectation, with Pythagorean Expectation being better than previous Win% and Regressed Win%. I don't know that any other conclusions should be drawn from these results, though.

I have a casual background with calculus and linear regression from college and decided to finally take a stab at some sabermetrics. However, I can't seem to get past the seemingly simple concept of starting run expectancy. I picked up The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball and cannot mentally move forward without completely understanding how they derived the starting run expectancies for all the events. This is in reference to table 3 in chapter 1. It makes sense that the overall starting run expectancy of 0.546 is derived by taking the average of all the events, but how are the individuals derived? This seems to be important towards conceptualizing wOBA.

I tend to overthink things which is probably the prognosis here, but please help a newbie get started.

Joe Beimel was one of the names on that list, I noticed his name in particular because not only was I looking for low LD% pitchers but also pitchers who give up a lot of fly balls; Oakland Coliseum (my favorite team) has one of the lowest  HR/FB% in the majors. I noticed him and a few other guys with low LD% also have a very low SO/9 percentage usually in the 6 or 5 range.

"tl;dr Came up with kind of a ""Fermi Problem"" &amp; interesting way of equating two events via **VERY ROUGH ESTIMATES** to find out that they're on the same order of magnitude. It's a crude method and I'd like your help improving it. At the end I will list some assumptions/questions/etc. Also should I have posted this in /r/statistics or go cross-post it?


The other day it occurred to me that, as a mathematical event, a Perfect Game is the same as an event ""27 Consecutive Batters Fail To Reach Base."" I wanted to know if this was empirically true and figured I could make some assumptions due to the (strong or weak?) Law of Large Numbers. My sample size was data going back to 1900. To make it simple I just cut down my calculation to n=100 years.


I guessed there have been roughly 20 perfect games in the MLB (it's 21 official but again, order of magnitude estimate.) I needed to figure out the number of games in a season: with 30 teams and 162 games per team each year, how many games were there? Obviously I can't double-count, so I need to add *unique* events: every team plays 81 home games, which are distinct events, so there are 2430 games per season. So I estimated 2.43x10^3 times 10^2 seasons for a total of 2.43x10^6 games played. 20 of those have been perfect, so roughly, Pr[Perfect Game] = 2x10^1 / 2.43x10^6 ~= 10^-5


Next I wanted to figure out what the all-time ""OBP"" is. This was a little bit trickier - I guessed it was between 0.300 and 0.35. I cheated on this one and went ahead and looked up some data. Off the cuff, I saw more seasons that were near .310 and so just decided to go with Pr[Any batter reaches base all-time]=0.32

Assuming each plate appearance is independent, then Pr[27 Consecutive Batters Fail To Reach] = (1 - 0.32)^27 which gave me a number (distinctly lower, though), yet again, ~= 10^-5


This is really off-the-cuff stuff but I thought it was neat that these two events were on the same order of magnitude and I thought it was cool. Are there major flaws in my thinking? Can you help me find ways to improve this? I just thought this was pretty cool :)


Errors:
1. A string of 27 consecutive batters not reaching base may not imply a perfect game. All I have done is calculate the probability of *any group* of batters to not reach base 27 times. Surely there are other ways for this to happen (split over two games, or just any sequence of 27 outs)  There are a lot of flaws with this because I didn't figure out a way to say ""27 consecutive batters - in a single game.""
2. I assume each plate appearance is independent. Obviously this isn't the case: the more a batter sees a pitcher, the more he'll pick up on what he's throwing and be able to adjust. Yet in a perfect game, assuming the pitcher is ""on his game"" So I justified this assumption by figuring these would just (so conveniently!) cancel one another out.
3. History, in so many ways. There were not always 30 teams. There were not always 162 games. Also...
4. The league-average OBP has increased over time .... BUT there have been more perfect games as of late. What's up with this paradox?
5. The distribution of perfect games throughout time is odd - there was a 30-year stretch with no perfect games, and then in the last 30 years, we've had so many of them. Maybe I should just shrink my dataset to the past 30 years?
6. A ton of other small things.

I'd really love to hear what people have to say about this. Feel free to educate me as well :) Thanks!!!

**note:** I would really like to plot the league-average OBP over the past century, and then mark off the years with perfect games. Any help on the best way to do that?

In the google doc i named my new version of wOBA, jOBA. Each jOBA comes numbered with the multiplier i used for BB's (original formula used .69).

"In light of the discussion about trading Gattis, I thought it would be helpful to put together an estimate of how much he'll actually be worth over the time frame we're discussing trading him. As a starting point, I took the fact that Gattis is projected for about 3.3 WAR per 120 games this year and took that as a baseline (hardly scientific but I doubt that many people would come up with a meaningfully different number). I estimated Gattis would provide about 15 WAR over the next 4 years (3.5 WAR next year with an additional .5 WAR per year for framing and .25 WAR decline each year after). Based on some previous arb salaries (namely Buster Posey's settlement after his MVP year), I was able to give a pretty aggressive estimate of how much he'd be paid in his arb years ($8M, $12M, &amp; $16M). Subtracting his value from his pay gave $61.4M in excess value. Discounting framing entirely would reduce his excess value to $47.9M.

Now, this is a rough estimate and I wanted to be make this a collaborative effort, so beneath this paragraph is a link to a Google Doc that you can download and play around with. You can make any changes you want (including discounting framing, changing his arb awards, or putting in a different estimation of his future WAR) and use this to continue to evaluate contract situations in the future.

"Okay, range factor has basically shattered Robbie's reputation as a superior gloveman, and that's fair. During several years of his prime, he was actually below league average for 2B range factor.

HOWEVER, should playing roughly half his games on artificial turf in Toronto be taken into effect? If so, how can that be measured and quantified? (Further, is it true that ground balls go faster on artificial turf, and if so, how much faster?)

In looking at the numbers, Alomar's range factor was above league average at 2B when he played for San Diego, and then it shot to below league average in Toronto, and then it went to slightly above league average when he went to Baltimore. It eventually tailed off around his age 30-31 years, when he went to Cleveland. 

Thus, while Alomar wasn't ever necessarily a god-tier 2B (though he did make it look spectacular on occasion, and something can be said for looking good in a venue that exists to entertain), I would argue that he was still an above-average gloveman, and the artificial turf of Toronto hurt his numbers.

* Will it be necessary to project hit type and location? Obviously, this would be more accurate, however, is it absolutely necessary?

I am fairly new to the whole sabermetrics thing, and I am particularly interested in PITCHf/x data, something I have only really used as the strike zone on the TV screen :p. I've been doing a lot of looking around at the range of data and graphics based on PITCHf/x available at Fangraphs and BrooksBaseball etc., but I'm getting really curious about reading more of the ""original literature"" and research that has been done on PITCHf/x since it came out in 2007 or whatever. Can you guys point me towards what you think are some of the seminal/most important articles on the subject (ex. I know I can go look up pitch framing stats, but I'd be interested to see the research that got us there). I really want to dive into this stuff, I don't really care about how dry or boring it may seem!

Many thanks!!",1
"I'm a graduate student studying statistics and I want to do my thesis on something in the realm of baseball analytics.  I was wondering if anybody has any ideas of areas to look into.  

I know just about every aspect of the game has been covered extensively already.  I've looked into 

* Lineup optimization 

* A regression model for predicting runs scored by inputting various information (offensive lineup, opposing pitcher/defense, stadium factor)

* Evaluating a players' true value based on salary

* Using PitchFX data to build a model to look at hitters' likelihood of getting a hit based on the matchup vs. a specific pitcher.

Shot in the dark, but thanks in advance!   ",1
"The only one I can find is the FanGraphs Oliver projections where it assumes every player will have 600 PAs.

I don't want to take a projection for a player that is supposed to play 90 games and extrapolate it out to if they played 162 at that exact pace.

"Hi,

Im currently teaching myself all about sabermetrics via the Fangraphs website, and I'm a little stumped on how to calculate the above stats, Every time I enter the formula I seem to get the wrong answer, any help with this would be great.",1
"Consider everything behind a run. That run, however it occurred, was simultaneously scored and allowed. If you could determine properly whether it was scored more than it was allowed, or vice versa, you might be from the future. On the scoring side, the run-makers are easy to identify: you have the batters in sequence, or better yet the singular batter, and you have some contribution as well from baserunners, if they are there. Allowing is trickier business, for blame can be allocated to the pitcher for throwing, the catcher for calling and receiving, individual defenders for fielding, the defense for its shift, not to mention any pitchers or defenders who might have been removed earlier in the inning. Those are all the on-field factors behind run production, if I’m not mistaken; we could further muck things up if we broadened our line of thinking to in-game factors, including therefore managers and their ability to determine pitcher-batter matchups at any given moment.

For some runs credit or blame is obvious. Nelson Cruz should have caught that ball. Barry Bonds made a throw so weak the slowest runner in the game scored. The vast majority of runs, however, are subject to countless apportions of credit and blame. Ask 10 people if Mariano Rivera really blew Game 7 in 2001, or Game 4 in 2004. Do the events of those innings fall primarily on his shoulders? There would certainly be those who point instead to the virtues of Luis Gonzalez and Dave Roberts. Even the two obvious examples I cited above have alternate and dissenting readings, held by wackos. We’ve only just begun to quantify all the ways catchers and fielders affect run-scoring. The stats modeling those two factors are years (possibly decades) behind the models for batting.

Batting has long been the most popular and recorded factor behind run scoring. Not only is it easier to discern, but there’s something heroic about the solitary batter overcoming all of the people and circumstances conspiring against him. He counterattacks an incoming missile with controlled intensity and a club, confounding eight other men who have arranged themselves to stop him. Even the playing field, narrow and front-facing, favors the defense, so that even the best players succeed in making a base less than half the time. The rarity of run-scoring contributes to the extra euphoria felt when runs do occur, compared to the scoring and euphoria in other sports. All these are reasons why batting has been measured about as long as the game has existed at a professional level.

Batting might only be the tip of the Run-Production Iceberg, but we’ve been acquainted with and fascinated by that tip for so long that we understand it pretty damn well by now. Batting average had a long, perhaps undeserved reign, then on-base percentage and slugging got their due. Tom Tango’s weighted On-Base Average (wOBA) is the latest and best statistic in that vein. The two shining attributes of wOBA are:

1. It looks at the run-scoring environment before assigning weights to different kinds of batting outcomes, ensuring that the statistic comes out league-adjusted. [Here’s a link](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/1/4/1912914/custom-woba-and-linear-weights-through-2010-baseball-databank-data) to all the weights for each year up to 2010. And [here's a fuller explanation](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/a-visual-look-at-woba/) of the mathematical reasons wOBA works better than OBP and SLG.

2. It is scaled so that the league average wOBA is the same as the league average OBP.

A neat thing about the second point is that you can compare a player’s wOBA and OBP to quickly gauge what kind of power he has. Suppose a player’s wOBA exceeds his OBP by .030 points. You would then know that player has a lot of power, [power that OBP is inherently unable to recognize](http://www.insidethebook.com/ee/index.php/site/article/getting_to_know_woba/).

Furthermore, wOBA has become the foundation for other popular batting measures. Both weighted Runs Created (wRC) and weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA) are based off wOBA and attempt to quantify the raw number of runs produced by a player. While wRC describes the total number of runs a player has created, wRAA calculates runs created relative to league average run-creating. These are both counting stats, so players with more playing time will accrue more. You can find the formulas for wRC and wRAA [here](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/wrc-and-wraa/).

There is one more stat based on wOBA, and it might now be more popular than wOBA itself. Weighted Runs Created Plus (wRC+) measures a player’s wRC against league average, scaled to 100. This is a rate stat, where 100 is league average, and every number above 100 is a percentage point above league average. Same goes for numbers below 100. No matter how many plate appearances a player had, a 120 wRC+ means he produced 20 percent more runs than a league average player would have in the same number of PAs. It is fully park- and league-adjusted. Read more about it [here](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/wrc/).

Let's start some controversy over how we should pronounce these stats: [vote now omg!!!!](http://marcianolopez.polldaddy.com/s/how-do-you-pronounce-woba)

Finally some wOBA leaderboards: [2013](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2013&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=16,d), [the 2010s](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2010&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=16,d), [the 2000s](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2009&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2000&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=16,d), [career](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=1871&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=16,d).",1
"[According to fangraphs.com, wOBA can be converted into wRAA pretty easily.](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/woba) 

&gt; wOBA can be converted into offensive runs above average easily. These are called Weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA). The formula to convert wOBA into wRAA is listed below.........

wOBA only shows how good a hitter is at the plate. (also stated in the site the link directs) 

But when I read *weighted runs above average* I would assume that it also contains baserunning, speed, etc. (because that sounds to me like it values a player's overall offensive force) 

**If I am right,** how is it possible to convert wOBA to wRAA when wRAA contains a lot more factors than wOBA?",1
"Fangraphs states the following on their wRAA page:

&gt; When calculating Wins Above Replacement (WAR), wRAA is used to represent offensive ability. Ten wRAA is equal to +1 win.

This says that wRAA is kind of the offensive sabermetric to calculate WAR. 

That leads me to the following questions:

- What other categories are contained in offensive WAR? Wasn't that also baserunning? And positional adjustments? What about fielding? Does that category also play a role in WAR?

- what **exact** sabermetrics (specific names) are used to calculate offensive WAR? What are used for calculating pitching WAR?

Basically, I want to know what's behind WAR. If I look at WAR I want to know what category how much influenced that WAR value.

Sorry for any typos/mistakes. I had troubles expressing myself a few times while writing this as I'm not living in an English speaking country.

Thank you guys.",1
"1. What's the difference?

"Swinging-strike percentage (SwStr%) is one of my favorite things to look at for pitchers, especially young guys that I don't get to see very often. Generally I'd wager that the higher a guy's SwStr%, the better his stuff looks.

Data sets as large as 1748!!! Also a steady stream of jokes. The way I see it, you just might like them. I would have further outlined my ideas here but I have to go the old pub. Cheers! Once I'm back home I'll refresh this page obsessively.",1
"I have access to some PitchFX data and want to try to categorize the pitchers (fastball pitcher, Kershaw-style deception pitcher, etc.). Because it's a large data set, going through each pitcher and attributing a pitching style would take forever.

My first thought is to look at the frequency with which pitchers use certain pitches, and use that to separate the styles. Any suggestions or ideas for alternative methods for classification?",1
"In a thread yesterday, we discussed what we'd like to see on this sub, and a popular idea was a daily/weekly discussion on one statistic. We don't yet have the traffic for a good discussion to be completed in a day, so let's start with weekly and let's start today, why not.

Any aspect of the stat may be discussed here. I'll try to get us going.

BABIP stands for Batting Average on Balls In Play. It measures the frequency with which a runner gets on base out of all the times he hits a ball into play, therefore excluding home runs, walks and strikeouts (among other, rarer events). BABIP is frequently cited when predicting future success or downward regression, as it's one of the most volatile stats out there, and any large deviation from the mean is probably influenced by a great deal of luck, whether you're looking at the stat for hitters or for pitchers. Bradley Woodrum, a NotGraphs author, made a tutorial video for BABIP, [here it is on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8XEZlfwCT4).

[Here's](http://midnightbaseball.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/babiplargefunny.png) BABIP in a historical context (I posted this yesterday). You can see that the league average BABIP spiked drastically in the early 1990s. The graph has a silly title that suggests bad defense is the issue, which it could be. It could also be beefed up 'roiding hitters knocking more line drives all over the place. It could be beefed up 'roiding hitters playing worse defense because it's hard to move all that beef out in the field. It could be that small, lithe defenders were losing roster spots to beefed up 'roiding dudes. (It doesn't have to be related to steroids, but come on.) It could be that expansion diluted the pool of pitching talent; or that Coors Field is enormous enough to move the needle a full .020. I was born around this time, so I've never seen the game when played with a .280 league-average BABIP. How sad.

Anyway, I'll end this with four leaderboards. BABIP leaders from [2013](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2013&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=12,d), [the 2010s](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2010&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=12,d), [the 2000s](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2009&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2000&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=12,d), and [all-time](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=1871&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=12,d).",1

"I don't post on Reddit much so I'm not sure if there has been a discussion about this before, so I'll start one.

So why is WAR minus WAA not always the same?  It seems like it would be, or maybe at least for a certain position.

"So I have been trying to figure out relevant splits that are more precise to a specific matchup.

I have been researching the relevancy of a hitters p/f splits (and also hitters splits against gb and fb pitchers..or more specifically pitchers in the top and bottom third in gb/fb ratio)

So back to the point, pf ratio. I have seen conflicting studies. Some say that it is useful while others say it is not very predictive. 

What are your thoughts on the matter? I am leaning towards believing it can be telling in the most extreme cases, and even at that point I think you should still undervalue the actual split itself (say a guy hits 50 points better against finesse pitchers, I think you can safely assume he prefers facing finesse pitchers but only use about half of that advantage when predicting future performance). Also, I think classifying power and finesse pitchers is another one where the top third and bottom third can be considered powe and finesse and the middle third can be considered average.

"So this year, sabermetrics was pushed into the limelight with the race between Cabrera and Trout for MVP, and, as we all know, Cabrera and the traditionalists won.

Do you think Trout becoming the poster boy of sabermetrics hurt his candidacy since he clearly showed great value by traditional stats?

I'd also like to weight the results by run differential and opponent strength.

The idea is to discard the team's season except for the last five games.  Any team can get hot.  If the Twins sweep the Yankees in three games and then the Rangers in four, outscoring both of them by 20 runs, they're hot.  On the other hand if very good teams kick weaker teams asses that wouldn't rate quite as highly.

I figured the ultimate number could be sort of like the temperature thing that Bill James came up with for hitters, but more useful.

"It's the second time I've asked, but the first time I asked we had less than half as many subscribers.

Right before the All-Star Break I tried to do the Saber All-Star team.  It was certainly nothing groundbreaking and it wasn't even all that interesting.  The reason I did it was to hopefully get some conversations going.  Maybe if people sorta got to ""know"" each other there might start to be a little more activity in the subreddit.  Unfortunately that didn't work.  

In /r/baseball, I suggested that u/highpothetically post his question about taking pitches here in this subreddit.  Obviously the hypothetical is a bit outrageous but the question it raises is pretty interesting.  My math skills aren't sharp enough to tackle it but I thought others would, and it would be a good learning experience.  But nobody has replied.

Is it unrealistic to think this should be an active community?  This subreddit was dead as a doornail, abandoned by its mod with no recent posts.  Before I asked the admins for the keys, I mentioned it to a few people. They were skeptical that it would ever thrive.  I saw no reason why it wouldn't, but I guess I understand now what they were talking about.  Sabermetrics *are* talked about in /r/baseball and in the individual team subreddits even if they aren't appreciated by everyone.  Maybe the topic is too narrow to build a subreddit around, I don't know.  

So I'm not really sure what to do next, and am happy to take suggestions.",1
"Originally I was trying to think of a good way to measure closers.  For example, if a closer is inconsistent, then they could have five or six bad outings, but be stellar in between and still put up the same stats as someone who is a little less than stellar, but consistent.  I would think the consistent option would be the better option for that position.  Now I know we could simply break down the splits, but I was wondering if there are any good statistics that wrap consistency into a neat bow.",1
"Was reading up on how to regress a hitters K rate, and came across xBB%. [The formula for calculating it can be found here](http://mlbplayeranalysis.blogspot.com/2012/08/xbb.html) although I can't make sense of it. See the basic calculation that I pulled from the article below:

---------------------------

**Ball%**: (1-Zone%) * (1 - O-Swing%)

**CallStr%**: (Zone%) * (1 - Z-Swing%)

**SwStr%:** SwStr%

**InPlay%:** (HBP + GB + FB + LD) / Pitches

**Foul%:** 1 - Ball% - CallStr% - SwStr% - InPlay%

From here, we can use the percentages to calculate the probability that a hitter will walk. To do so, we can break it down into the probability of a walk on 4 pitches, 5 pitches, 6 pitches, etc. and then sum up these probabilities. We get the following components:

**Walk4%:** (Ball%)^4
The chance of a four pitch walk occurring is simply the chance that four consecutive pitches are balls.

**Walk5%:** (4 choose 1) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%) * (Ball%)^4

The chance of a five pitch walk involves a little more thought. The only way that this can occur is if four of the pitches are balls, obviously, but the other pitch is any form of strike (i.e. not a ball in play or HBP). In this case, the strike could come on the first pitch of the plate appearance, or on the 1-0 count, 2-0 count or 3-0 count. Using basic probability math, we have to ""choose"" one location for this strike out of these four possibilities. ""4 choose 1"" evaluates to 4. Likewise we could ""choose"" the four locations of the balls in the first five pitches, and that is why ""4 choose 4"" also evaluates to 4.

**Walk6%:** (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 * (Ball%)^4

The logic used for the six pitch walk is just an extension of the five pitch walk. There must now have been two strikes (of any form) in the first five pitches of the plate appearance before having the sixth pitch be ball four. So again we ""choose"" the location of either the two strikes or the three balls, as ""5 choose 2"" and ""5 choose 3"" both evaluate to 10.

**Walk7%**: (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 *(Foul%) * (Ball%)^4

A seven pitch walk is the first that requires a very particular occurrence to achieve. While the first five pitches are evaluated just like the six pitch walk, in this case, the sixth pitch must result in a foul ball. Any other result would end the plate appearance in the sixth pitch.

**Walk8%:** (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 *(Foul%)^2 * (Ball%)^4

The eight pitch walk is an extension of the logic from the seven pitch walk. In this case, both the sixth and seventh pitches must be foul balls.

**Walk9%:** (5 choose 2) * (CallStr% + SwStr% + Foul%)^2 *(Foul%)^3 * (Ball%)^4

By this point you get the picture. The contributing term from the nine pitch walk is already at most 0.06%, so this is the last term we will calculate in this model. It makes sense, intuitively, as few plate appearances extend into double digit pitch counts.

----------------------------

This version of xBB% will be defined then as:

xBB% = (Walk4% + Walk5% + Walk6% + Walk7% + Walk8% + Walk9%) * N

where N is a constant, league-wide normalization factor (for 2012 to date N=0.75).

---------------------------

***So the question is, what the hell is (4 choose 1)x and (5 choose 2) and is it constant or can it be (4 choose 1-4)x and (5 choose 1-5)x?***

Edit: Ah binomial coefficients...

"So when analyzing a players numbers to project future performance there are a million factors in play. One of the most difficult factors to understand and factor out is luck. BABIP is certainly a helpful tool, although it takes 3 seasons before a hitters BABIP gets close enough to its equilibrium that it can be considered useful. So certainly BABIP is a somewhat useful tool to determine which way a hitters numbers will regress.

However xBABIP hit the scene hard and the formula has been tweaked a handful of times since its inception. [I believe the most recent way to calculate xBABIP is courtesy of slash12](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2009/11/10/1124792/a-new-xbabip-calculator)

xBABIP =0.391597252 + (LD% x 0.287709436 ) + ((GB% - (GB% * IFH%) ) x -0.151969035 ) + ((FB% - (FB% x HR/FB%) - (FB% x IFFB%)) x -0.187532776) + ((IFFB% * FB%) x -0.834512464) + ((IFH% * GB%) x 0.4997192 )

A simple explanation is that it takes into account a hitters LD, GB, FB rates and attempts to regress the BABIPs for those types of hits closer to the league average while also taking into account speed (IFH%). 

So what do you guys think about the predictive power of BABIP an xBABIP? Is xBABIP only helpful to adjust previous #s retrospectively?

Going a step further, what the hell is xBA? I haven't been able to find a specific formula explanation, but I believe it is just xBABIP adjusted Batting Average. (comparing xBABIP to a hitters actual BABIP for a given year, determining the difference and than adjust according to how many more hits they should have had...weighted according to how often they put the ball into play relative to the rest of their plate appearances)

----------------------------

Obviously certain players develop certain tendencies, and hitters BABIPs for ground balls, fly balls, and line drives will vary. This is one of the biggest issues with xBABIP in my opinion, but when a hitter has been in the league for a while I think using a combination of BABIP and xBABIP to determine future batting average is the way to go.

And finally, are there any other flaws with xBABIP that I haven't considered?

"Howdy folks,
    I started reading up on Sabermetrics about two years ago and have slowly begun to understand the varying ways by which we analyze players now in today's game. There are still many many different statistics that I don't understand, and which ones that provide the best analysis but that's a post for another time.

I think that what I am most lacking in is not knowing what to do with the information in front of me. For example when I look at a player's BABIP, or their WAR, I understand the statistic itself, but I lack the context of whether or not those numbers are good or bad. What is the league average for WAR for pitchers, for example. What is an excellent xFIP, can I just correlate that to ERA or is there something more subtle involved? 

I feel that I knew the baselines for these stats, I could actually make judgements on what the quality of players are and aren't: does anybody know perhaps of a website or list that would aid me in furthering my understanding?? Thanks so much",1

"An interesting article in Baseball Prospectus today by Pizzacutter, whose real name is apparently Russel Carleton.  It's very short and takes the form of an apology to Joe Morgan (ack).  [You can read it here if you like.](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=17603)

We've talked a little about this before in terms of weaknesses of defensive stats and so forth, but what specifically do you look for when you're watching a game on TV?  Do you have the spreadsheets open along with websites full of stats?  Do you just watch and that's it?  Do you watch very closely, timing the pitcher's move to the plate with runners on, paying close attention to a swing to see if there's a ""hole"" to exploit, watching pitchers' mechanics?  Combination?

I'm wondering if you guys are statheads in the purest sense of the word or if you have a little ~~Chuck~~ Joe Morgan in you, too.

Personally I don't often pay attention to advanced stats during the game.  I may have a vague recollection of a player's numbers, but even though I usually watch the game at my desk I rarely look these numbers up.  I do that before the game when there's time, and afterward.  While watching I vacillate between watching casually and catching as much detail as the cameras will allow.  When at the ballpark I'm primarily there to have fun, though if I'm seeing a prospect for the first time I will often pay attention to what goes on with him.",1

"I posted the below at r/baseball, but not sure that was the right forum.

I have an idea but not the mathematical acumen to execute it. This is where I hope my Reddit brethren can assist.

The idea is as follows: create a model for how a pitcher should pitch any given batter using expected values and game theoretic decision trees; use the model as a sabermetric surrogate for scouting reports to inform your in-game pitching or hitting plans or measure pitchers against this model to determine if their stats could be better if only they had a better coaching staff or catching unit.

Premise 1: batters will perform better when they know what pitch is coming.
Premise 2: pitchers therefore can't simply rely on one pitch or approach.

A simple example: a pitcher can throw a ball or a strike. If the pitcher throws a ball when the hitter thinks it will be a strike, advantage pitcher. If the pitcher throws a strike when the hitter thinks it will be a strike, advantage hitter.

If we add simple numbers to the above, we can start cobbling together expected values for any given pitch. With expected values, we can create decision trees and optimal results. For example, we can conclude that, when facing a right handed batter with a 30% O-Swing%, 60% O-Contact%, 60% Z-Swing, and 80% Z-Contact, and a 500 SLG, the expected OPS on a pitch outside the zone is 800 (100 SLG + 700 OBP), and the expected OPS on a pitch inside the zone is 480 (240 SLG + 240 OBP) (NOTE: I realize my calculations of OBP here are essentially rubbish, but bear with me). Therefore, the optimal first pitch is a strike. Of course, this calculus changes dramatically if the batter is guessing that the first pitch will be a strike, and it changes further when we add complexities such as what type of pitch to throw, how hard, and where in the strike zone.

So the idea is to develop a computerized model for optimal pitching results (e.g., to batter x, first pitch throw a fastball strike 45% of the time, change up strike 20% of the time, fastball ball 20% of the time, change up ball 15% of the time; if first pitch resulted in a strike, on second pitch throw . . . , etc.), and then compare that to actual pitching results. If a pitcher deviates wildly from his optimal pitching model across many batters, then we can conclude that perhaps better pitch selection would lead to superior results. We could then also compare teams and their coaching staffs, or catchers and their game calling skills. I imagine this information would be extremely useful to a savvy baseball team scouting for woefully mismanaged pitchers to target in a trade. This information could also be useful to fantasy baseball players looking to predict how their favorite pitchers will perform now that they're pitching to Catcher X or have been traded to Team Y.

Curious to hear your thoughts on the above.",1
"I know it's not the most original idea, but it would be something to do.  I think we should have 25 man rosters.  Two catchers, five starting pitchers and a long man, a DH, and fill it out with relievers and bench guys who can play a couple of positions.",1

I am skeptical of most analysis of sports from laymen, not because they are stupid, but because they most likely don't watch enough games and the numbers can always fool you. Or they are stupid. 

I will attempt to interact with the community in a Socratic method and ask questions I have always been curious about. I believe that no one is impervious to misjudgement. And just perhaps, we can learn the old and discover the new that the baseball world has never seen before.

To give some motivation: I'm writing a baseball simulation program (nothing fancy, just to teach myself Python), and my current technique was to just get a simple linear regression relationship (for the past few seasons) that relates 1B%, etc, to SLG. They correlate pretty well (for HR% the R^2 is .75; for 1B%, R^2 = .69) but there must be more to it than that, right? Maybe something with K/9?

The first part now: One thing I like to look at, in terms of team offensive performance, is the percentage of hitters who make it on base that end up scoring. To put it simply, runs/(hits+walks+HBP). However, I'm not sure what an equivalent stat would be for an individual hitter, as to compare him to his team, or league average. I would think wRC/(hits+walks+HBP) makes sense.

"I live on the Iowa side of the Quad Cities (think: Davenport).   Because I'm in Iowa, I am blacked out from the Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, and Kansas City Royals.

This is the distance and driving time to each ballpark:

MIN: 5:30 and 354 miles  
MIL: 3:25 and 215 miles  
CWS and CHC: 2:45 and 175 miles  
STL: 4:05 and 270 miles

The reason Iowa is blacked out from all of these is because of the regional sports networks in existence,  2 counties in Northern Iowa get the Twins, two counties in southwest Iowa get the Royals, 3 counties in Southeast Iowa get the Cardinals, about 5 counties near the Wisconsin border get the Brewers, 10 counties in eastern Iowa get the White Sox, and 4 get the Cubs.  


And because MLB is too cheap and/or lazy to spend $50,000 for a location program and about another 50,000 to develop the server software , because Golly Gee Whiz, that's about one game's pay for many superstars, so that the only people getting blacked out are the ones who can actually GET the regional sports station carrying the blacked-out game --- hello MLB!  Fox Regionals aren't carried in most places anymore, unless they're specific to the team in that area --- they just erase the whole @#@%%@ state instead.

Or maybe they're using the ""They may go to the game in person if we don't let them watch it"" argument.  Yeah, that argument worked really well last year when there wasn't any attendance.    Like people are going to drive 300+ miles regularly to go to a game anyway.

It gets really old.  Other leagues offer the option to pay extra to be able to watch in-market games --- not that Minnesota, St. Louis, and Kansas City are in-market where I live.   Have them pay an extra $50 a year and then give some of it to the regionals.  But MLB is still ru nning its version of the old reserve clause, for viewing.  Like the original reserve clause, it was outdated a long time ago, and like the old reserve clause, it will probably take MLB 20 years to fix the blackout nonsense.",0

The NBA and the NFL (to some extent) are fare more driven based on personality. People vibe wit LeBron and Luka because they're the most important person on the floor at all times. With baseball, and all its unwritten rules, the bat flip seems to be a prime example of something the Majors need. Fans get pumped when the players are pumped.

While the current narrative is that the celebration is disrespectful, it seems wildly mild compared to what we see in other sports. Perhaps giving players the freedom to express when they've owned a pitcher is something we can be a little more lax on.

"Under 10 is at -115. What y'all think? SEE BELOW.

I received a lot of support yesterday in releasing a few trends &amp; picks that were intriguing to me on the MLB models I've been working very hard on and went 3-0 on what I released on Reddit. 

I also received a ton of haters &amp; negative comments and wasn't expecting that. At the end of the day I appreciate all of the comments but just to be clear on a few things:

\#1 This is not intended to be a bet recommendation of any sort. Just wanted to share along with y'all as I keep refining my model. It's a work in progress so I'm always open to all comments - I appreciate all of them. You have full control over your decisions to ride with me or fade. 

\#2 Reddit MLB Record: 3-0 

\#3 MLB record Season Start. All tracked: 

o 89-4-49 \[64.5% W/(W+L) rate\] 

o Average Line Played: +103|2.03x

o Profitability YTD: +37.48 Units (Current Unit Size: 4% of bankroll)

No parlays. Only straight bets. In order to be profitable, you need to have a clip of 52.4% on an average line of -110|1.90x.

Other interesting stats favorable to the Under:

\*\*\*The Under is now Under is 11-1 in the last 12 meetings between the 2 teams.\*\*\*

But how can he be overrated only because of defense, when no one calls him a really good fielder, yes he has Gold Gloves but that’s more of a “who’s the best ss” competition. Anyways I don’t understand how he’s overrated when no one (except yankee fans) call him the best or a great fielder. Yes he made many clutch defensive plays but still not good at defense.

"- Our model has been on point when it comes to Red Sox matchups. The past 5 have been correct, with a majority of them being plus money lines.
- Bostons starting rotation has been solid all-around but Martin Perez may be the best guy going, and he is starting tonight for the Red Sox.
- On the other end of the mound we have Framber Valdez. Valdez has given up 2 runs in 11 innings on the year so far. He struck out 10 to just 2 walks in that most recent victory over the Red Sox.
- Head to Head Stat - The Under is 10-1 in the last 11 meetings.
- The Under is 9-2 in the last 11 Red Sox games when the Red Sox's road win percentage when facing a right handed pitcher is more than 65% on the season
- The Under is 8-2 in the last 10 Astros games when the runs total is more than 9.5. The runs total is 10.
- Our model projects this game to be between 8.32 - 8.67 Runs (i.e. between 8-9 Runs). Lay a unit on the under in this one.

"A “Kris Bryant for JD Davis and prospects” trade is the most ass backwards thing I’ve ever heard. The Mets’ primary struggles right now revolve around offense, and it may come as a shock to a lot of people pushing for the trade, but Kris Bryant and JD Davis are comparable offensively. Actually, comparable is putting it lightly, they’re bordering on identical. Kris Bryant made an All-Star game in 2019 with an OPS+ of 133, and JD Davis is constantly in trade talks after posting an OPS+ of 133 in the same exact season. Both JD and Bryant struggled in the covid shortened season, but even then JD outperformed him on a rate basis. That’s without even mentioning the absolute tear JD was on prior to his injury. The offense needs a shot in the arm, so trading a guy who’s batting .390 right now with an OPS+ north of 200 who was absolutely raking in his rehab assignments for a bordering on identical (and some could argue worse) offensive player that costs 10 times as much is apparently the only solution. If the Mets trade JD we will regret it for the foreseeable future, and that’s not even thinking about the prospects we’d lose in the deal. Let’s go over the luxury tax to completely stagnate offensively because Bryant has some brand recognition. It makes no sense to me.",0

"Babe Ruth OF, SP (1914-1935)

Career accolades: Hall of Fame, MVP, 2x all star, 7x World Series champion, batting title, ERA title

Career hitting stats: 183.1WAR, .342/.474/.690 (SLG record), 2873 hits, 714HRs, 2214RBIs, 123SBs

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today. There’s a reason every player gets compared to him because there’s none other like the Babe

vs

Mike Trout CF (2011-)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, ROTY, 9x all star, 8x silver slugger, 2x AS MVP

Career stats (as of 2021): 76.1WAR, .305/.419/.583, 1419 hits, 310HRs, 816RBIs, 203SBs

Career highlight: being the first player to hit 30HRs, steal 45 bases and scoring 125 runs in one season

Best season (2018): .312/.460/.628, 147 hits, 39HRs, 24SBs, 79RBIs

Fun feat: Mike Trout was banned from the milk tower carnival game for winning to much

Analysis: take the talent of Griffey and translate it to today and you have trout. An exciting player since day one he has dazzled us since his entry into the league in ‘11. When he’s injured you feel the effects on the game because he is that fun to watch. Trout is a 5 tool player with one of the best personalities in sports and is undoubtedly the best player playing currently.

"Mariano Rivera CP (1995-2013)

Career accolades: hall of fame, 13x all star, 5x World Series champion, WS MVP, ALCS MVP, AS MVP, 5x reliever of the year

Career stats: 56.3, 2.21ERA, 652SVs (record), 1173Ks, 1WHIP, 1282.2IP

Career highlight: being the only unanimous hall of famer

Best season (2005): 1.38ERA, 43-47 in saves, 80Ks

Fun feat: Rivera has more saves then fellow HoFers Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage combined

Analysis: for many positions you can make an argument for different players as the greatest but when it comes to the greatest closer ever you can only have one name. Rivera is the best closer of all time while only throwing one pitch. His cutter was a nightmare for opposing hitters and any time he came in you could stop watching cause the game was over but you’d miss one of the best pitchers ever. 

vs

Walter Johnson SP (1907-1927)

Career accolade: hall of fame, 2x MVP, 3x Triple Crown, World Series champion, 5x ERA Title

Career stats: 164.8WAR, 2.17ERA, 417 wins, 1.06WHIP, 3509Ks, 531CGs, 110SHO (record)

Career highlight: throwing a no hitter which was the only one of his career

Best season (1913): 1.14ERA, 36-7, 29CG, 11SHO, 243Ks, .79WHIP

Fun feat: was known as the Big Train for throwing the fastest pitches of his time

Analysis: Johnson was a man amongst boys when put up against hitters of the time. Players back then could’ve sworn they were facing Nolan Ryan with the speeds Johnson was throwing. He was dominate facing the likes of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb in his time. For many he is the greatest pitcher ranking second in wins only to Cy Young

"Full disclosure: I had been an Astros fan my whole life. Way back in 2000, I can still remember my 5-year-old seeing then-brand new Enron Field (now Minute Maid Park) in all its majesty and beauty, rooting for what would quickly become my hometown heroes for the first time. This was back when we were graced with the likes of Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, both household names throughout my childhood. I can also remember the excitement of seeing them reach the World Series for the first time in 2005, and the crushing heartbreak when they didn't win. Their performances in the years afterward had fluctuated leading to some very lackluster seasons, yet I still stood by them no matter what, going to at least one game a year to show my undying support.

Then the mid-2010s came along and they were playing better than ever. The day that they would finally win the World Series - a day I had prayed for for *years* by that point - seemed to draw closer and closer. And as Hurricane Harvey brought chaos and devastation in its wake, fans like myself needed the Astros more than ever.

When they ultimately won the World Series that year, it felt like a Christmas miracle, a dream come true. I would see the trophy with my own eyes at Domecoming 2018, and it seemed like the shame of not having a WS win was finally over.

But... it had just begun.

Imagine how shocked I was when it was reported that they cheated to win that year. I tried not to think about too much, but ultimately I could no longer ignore it: the one time we won the World Series, and they threw it all away. They just couldn't help it. I felt betrayed by my own home team, and began to question my own fandom, especially everytime I see people relentlessly mocking them (particularly on Twitter). And don't get me wrong: I am very respectful of other people's opinions and I understand that we all go through our own different experiences; and Twitter isn't the best platform to go to anyway. But, at the same time... is this what being an Astros fan has become, supporting a team that got caught red-handed while the rest of the world sees them as the villain of the sport? Just thinking about it depresses me. And yet, what could we do? Win another World Series and do so legitimately? Even if there's evidence out the whazoo that we played fair and square, there's still gonna be plenty of people saying things like ""they didn't deserve that win"" or ""they definitely cheated, they're just hiding it from us"". Give up the trophy we have? That would have a better chance at bringing honor back to the team's name, but it would still be on our permanent record and it could take years to finally have our first legitimate win.

At this point, I am in a very difficult position. Perhaps I could be happier if the Astros were just not a part of my life, but at the same time I still have a tendency to support them because the thought of turning my back on a team that I had followed for so long is almost too painful for me to handle. I spoke with one of my relatives about it, and he said the best thing I could do is try to give them a second chance, and that makes sense to me. I believe that second chances are very important, and while it may not be easy I'd like to hope there's a way. I do NOT want that sign-stealing scandal to be the one thing that the Astros are known for for the rest of history. I don't want that for myself, any other Astros fan, or anyone who ever was, is, or will be a part of the organization itself (players or otherwise). But right now, I... I just don't know.

What should I do?

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it’d be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player.

Career stats: 59.6WAR, .285/.348/.482, 2150 hits, 358HRs, 1430RBIs, 30SBs

Career highlight: being a staple behind the plate for 10 of the Yankees 27 World Series wins

Best season (1954): .307/.367/.488, 179 hits, 22HRs, 125RBIs

Fun feat: Yogi is the only player to have double digit World Series rings and has the most in MLB history at 10

Analysis: Yogi was the first premier catcher in baseball. Before him the catching position was one of the weaker positions on the field but Yogi revolutionized it with his outstanding defense and prowess at the plate. A lot of people knock him saying he was just carried by the great teams he was on but he was a player that changed a position paving the way for players like Johnny Bench.

"Roger Clemens SP (1984-2007)

Career accolades: MVP, 7x Cy Young, 2x Triple Crown, 11x all star, 2x World Series champion, 7x ERA title, AS MVP

Career stats: 139.2WAR, 3.12ERA, 4672Ks, 1.17WHIP, 7.7H/9, 2.9BB/9, 8.6K/9

Career highlight: breaking the single game strikeout record… and then doing it again recording 20 strikeouts

Best season (1990): 21-6, 1.93ERA, 209Ks, 1.08WHIP

Fun feat: Clemens won the Cy Young in back to back years twice while winning the MVP in that span

Analysis: Clemens has one of the best pitching careers one can want. The longevity and success of his career is rarely matched by most players winning his first Cy Young in 1986 at the age of 23 while winning his 7th and final Cy Young at 41 in 2004. Clemens had the presence on the mound with the intimidation factor to match. 

vs

Cal Ripken Jr. SS, 3B (1981-2001)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, ROTY, 19x all star, World Series champion, 2x gold glove, 8x silver slugger, 2x AS MVP

Career stats: 95.9WAR, .276/.340/.447, 3184 hits, 431HRs, 1695RBIs, 5186TBs

Career highlight: breaking Lou Gehrigs consecutive game streak

Best season (1991): 11.5WAR (most by a SS), .323/.374/.567, 210 hits, 34HRs, 114RBIs

Fun feat: there is a conspiracy that the orioles faked an electrical issue so Cal could keep his game streak alive

Analysis: Cal may not have been one of the most consistent hitters to play the game but his longevity of playing and his glove at short made him a valuable player. Cal was reliable to play and play well. He was never a liability and his best years at the plate made him one of the best SS of all time.

"Stan Musial OF, 1B (1941-1963)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, 24x all star, 3x World Series champion, 7x batting title

Career stats: 128.7WAR, .331/.417/.559, 3630 hits, 475HRs, 1951RBIs 

Career highlight: hitting 5 home runs in a doubleheader

Best season (1948): .376/.450/.702, 230 hits, 39HRs, 131RBIs (came within a home run of the triple crown)

Fun feat: Musial has the same number of career hits at home and on the road

Analysis: One of the best hitters to ever swing the bat Stan was the player that future major leaguers looked up too. He was the Ted Williams of the NL with a great presence at the plate while having serviceable defense in the field. 

vs

Lou Gehrig 1B (1923-1939)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, Triple Crown, 7x all star, 6x World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 113.7WAR, .340/.447/.632, 2721 hits, 493HR, 1995RBIs, 5060TBs, 102SBs

Career highlight: Hitting 4 home runs in a single game

Best season (1927): .373/.474/.765, 218 hits, 47HR, 173RBIs, 52 doubles

Fun fact: Lou was the first athlete to appear on a box of wheaties 

Analysis: Lou was the robin to the Babes Batman who blossomed into the Nightwing of the team. One of the men that paved the way for the hard hitting first baseman he batted like only few in the league at the time. Gehrig was a great hitter with good defense at first and a cornerstone for the Yankees dynasty and a legend for more than just his on field skills

I'm doing all the MLB stadiums in blueprint and this is **Citi Field**.

Completed in 2009, it is the home field of the New York Mets. The stadium was built as a replacement for the adjacent Shea Stadium. It was designed by Populous (then HOK Sport).

It has a capacity of 41,922 and the interior design is primarily influenced by the Pittsburgh Pirates' PNC Park.

Citi Field features an overarching bridge motif in its architecture, as New York City is linked by 2,027 bridges and is reflected in the Mets logo. \[Source: Wikipedia\]

Bear in mind that he's going to turn 33 in a month and a half, only broke into the majors just before his 26th birthday, and plays for a team that seemingly refuses to give him run support and/or hold leads for him and that he is bound to for another 3 years. This isn't even factoring in an injury(ies) potentially cutting a beautiful thing short.

"Ok let’s play this out - you play from April to September (6 months). October if you make playoffs. 

Average relievers pitch one inning, maybe 2 (excluding long relievers).

How the fuck do they get injured so easily? 

You get starting pitchers who pitch 150 - 200 innings per year year, while relievers pitch 50-70 innings.

You get guys who play every day for 150-160 games fielding and batting.

- I mean I’m not belittling relievers, but what do they do in between games? Why do they drop like flies if they throw 15 pitches once every 2-3 days?

"To begin, the league is divided into three divisions: animals, people, and objects/things.

# Division 1: Animals (8 teams)

* Diamondbacks
* Cubs
* Tigers
* Orioles
* Cardinals
* Blue Jays
* Marlins
* Rays

# Division 2:  People (14 teams)

* Braves
* Royals
* Dodgers
* Brewers
* Twins
* Yankees
* Athletics
* Rangers
* Pirates
* Padres
* Mariners
* Nationals
* Mets
* Phillies

# Division 3: Objects/things (8 teams)

* Guardians
* Rockies
* Astros
* Red Sox
* White Sox
* Reds
* Giants
* Angels

Before I go into the skills, advantages, and disadvantages of each team I have to explain a few of the division choices and ground rules:

* the Giants and Angels were put in objects/things due to them not actually being people
* the Nationals, Mets, and Phillies in this case are the people of a Nation, of a Metropolitan, and of Philadelphia, respectively, and therefore fall under the ""people"" category
* if the animal, person, or thing can and normally does harm other animals, persons, or things they are allowed to do so within the extent of the gameplay.  For example, Diamondbacks are venomous and will bite things and kill them- during the game the Diamondbacks can not go and bite the whole other team rendering them useless, however as a strategic advantage they may bite someone running the base path to slow them down, same goes for other carnivorous animals and people who are known to have weaponry/willingness to attack. 
* Any and all projectile weaponry can only be used by a person once per at bat.  For example a Yankee can shoot someone trying to field their hit, but once the shot is taken they must wait until their next at bat to try and shoot someone else, this means they must choose between shooting the person fielding the ball, or the person guarding the base and can not simply shoot the whole team for a homerun each time.
* Innominate objects can move, ie statues can act like what they are made to represent and apparel can skirt around the field.

Feel free to make your educated guess from the above divisions, for a full scouting report on each team continue...

# Division 1- The Animals

* **Diamondbacks-** For this exercise we will say they can grip a bat with their tail to swing, and their strike zone is very very small and low to the ground which results in a ton of walks per game.  On the pitching side, when they work together they could use three snakes to slingshot the ball across the plate, however this leaves two gaps somewhere in the field, and their fielding is rather awful.  However, as mentioned above they have a trick up their fang in their venom, which they can use to temporarily immobilize any fielders they come across, if they can catch them.
* **Cubs-** These baby bears can throw and hit decently, and while they may not have the strength of full grown bears they do have some power and the advantage of a smaller strike zone.  Their lack of speed hurts them on the base path and in the field, but their ability to use their hands or mouth to catch the ball is helpful.  While running they also can help mess up they play with their sharp fangs and big paws.
* **Tigers-** Faster and more violent than cubs, the Tigers are an absolute menace on the base path, the tricky part for them is getting there.  These Tigers use their mouth to hold and swing the bat, while they also catch the ball with their mouth, pitching and throwing requires them to focus hard as they throw the ball from their mouth as well.
* **Orioles/Cardinals/Blue Jays-** The birds, their lack of strength and diminutive size leads to very few hits outside of the infield, however, this group has the advantage of a small strike zone and the ability to fly high and then back down to avoid tags, or attacks, from their in-division rivals- leading to many walks and steals.  They grip the bat and ball with their feet, and their ability to fly leads to very good fielding and very few homeruns. 
* **Marlins/Rays-** As the only marine animals the Marlins and Rays should win nearly every home game (accept when they play each other).  When they travel away you can tell they are very uncomfortable as they play like fish out of water, as they are in fact fish out of water.  

# Division 2- The People

* **Braves-** Native Americans invented many sports that have influenced our modern day games, combine that with the strength and fitness of hunting every day and you have a well trained group ready to tomahawk chop their way to the finals.
* **Royals-** ""Off with their heads"" the Royals are a difficult out on any day, they might not be too good at baseball, but upset them too much and who know what is waiting for you back in the dugout.
* **Dodgers-** Good luck tagging these guys out as they run the base path, too bad for them that you can simply touch the base instead... 
* **Brewers-** What better way to distract the opponent than to brew them endless beer until they are a sloppy mess?  With their endless supply of beer the Brewers can replace all water in the stadium with beer, leading to easy wins against drunk teams... as long as their opponent and not themselves drink their own supply. 
* **Twins-** Are you seeing double?  Nope just the twins in town.  With 18 people in the field their defense can be quiet stellar, and with two people in the batter box they are bound to hit something right?  Better just hope that the twins are athletic, and that they hit the ball and not each other.
* **Yankees/Rangers-** They might not be the most athletic, but their added bonus of rifles and revolvers help make up for any lack in athletic ability.
* **Athletics-** Some of the most Athletic people you have ever met, their raw talent and athletic abilities blow everyone else away- should be easy wins if your opponents didn't have guns, tomahawks, and beer.
* **Pirates/Mariners-** These swashbuckling opponents might not have the sturdiest of legs, but come visit them at their home field out at sea and it is you who will be leaving sick.  In addition to their unique homefield advantage, they too carry the casual side arm and sword in case their is need of it.
* **Padres-** These Friars have God on their side, but that doesn't necessarily turn them into Loyola University of Chicago.  For every athletic friar you get, you also get a friar who decided to spend the last five years living in a cave living off mushrooms.
* **Nationals/Mets/Phillies-** Every game nine randomly selected people are chosen from the nation, metropolitan, or Philadelphia respectfully to start for their team.  You might end up with 9 MVPS in your lineup or you might end up with 9 of [these guys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrqTVFuHxkQ)

# Division 3- The Objects and Things

* **Guardians-** You ever play baseball against 43 foot tall winged concrete statues? No? Well good luck.  Thankfully their are only 8 of them.
* **Rockies-** Ever try and hit a ball over a mountain?  Well you might want to practice for when the Rockies roll into town (you might also want to warn your town).  I am not sure how they hit or throw, but at least their defense is stellar (try sliding into first or running into home with a mountain in the way).
* **Astros-** I honestly would have no idea how this would work, any time they touch the ball it bursts into flames, probably would end up in a bunch of forfeits unless they used some fireproof trashcan to hold the ball.
* **Red Sox/White Sox/Reds-** I would recommend not wearing socks to any of these matches, as they might just turn against you and start working for the other team, other than that I am not sure what else they could do.  
* **Giants-** Like the guardians but not stone, the giants are a very formidable foe.  Their only downfall might be their size as they try and grip a tiny baseball and little bat.
* **Angels-** If we are talking Angels in the Outfield Angels then good luck playing against the best that baseball has to offer, if we are talking biblically described angels then good luck in not being scared shitless and forfeiting on the spot.

So there you have it, who wins and why?  Also feel free to call me out on anything I missed or any other advantages/disadvantages a team should have.",0

I argued that the talent gap would be massive and either pitching or hitting would dominate and would eventually be a wildly different sport… but truth is I dont really know would happen. Thoughts?,0
"In his letter, it mentioned that a lottery style draft was offered. That just sounds terrible and still could result in teams not spending money or just pure luck (and we all know which franchises have bad luck) sucking for long periods. 

My thought was that we should be rewarding the teams that made an effort. 

Draft pick one should go to the top winning percent team who missed the playoffs. So if there are 10 teams in the playoffs, team 11 should be pick 1. Through rank 30 getting pick 20. The remaining picks should go in order of elimination with the higher win percent getting the higher pick. 

Look at the teams that just missed this year? Or the teams the just traded everything away to get better picks? Or teams that just did nothing because they knew it was their best shot? 

I think this also may result in a little bit more spending from the bottom feeders too and ultimately lead to a much tighter race to the playoffs.",0
"I’m a European that has recently started enjoying baseball. I’ve started going to a minor league game and then start practicing some basic skills (I’m 30, but never too late I guess!).

I’d like to follow next season, and I’m sure I might change my mind based on that. However, I really need a team to support in the major league, since I live in a city with not mlb team. 

I did quizzes and watched highlights for plays and players, but I still can’t decide! 

So I guess, who should I support? Why are you a fan of the team you’re a fan of?",0
"Can someone breakdown the lockout like you're telling a 5 year old? I feel like I should be able to grasp what's going on but some is over my head. 

Much appreciated!",0
"To get right to the point, fans should be able to voice their opinion at any sort of mediation regarding the said players association and the owner's commission. Fans bring in the bulk of all the revenue. That includes not just at game revenue with their price gouging on tickets and concessions and merchandise. So why not let the fans have a seat at that table? We're the ones spending the money. Why can't we argue for cheaper ticket prices and lower concession prices and maybe being able to afford a nice jearsey that wouldn't cost 2/3 of my paycheck. It's obvious corporate green. But what does the lockout do? Who does it affect? The fans. The fans are the ones who are affected by the lockout. So they're still making money because we're still spending money on merchandise while they're not playing, but we don't have the luxury of being entertained by the said sport at the time at it's specific arena, stadium, etc. Why must the fans be punished by taking away an entertainment that a lot of us have deeply grown roots into the sports and sports teams. And then the players and owners want to cause a lockout because they can't agree to both be further greedy and want more money on top of certain rule changes that should just be decided and agreed upon by a third party. But ultimately in the end the fans are the ones who are punished, even though we're the ones spending our hard-earned money that a lot of us have to do a lot of physical labor to make that money, but we can't see it or watch a game even on TV because The players association and the owner's commission can't decide who gets to be more greedy. So again fans deserve a seat at the table. We'd be the best mediators, and since we're the cash cow we should be able to throw in our demands since they want to lock it out well let's lock it out but we're going to let the fans get in on this lockouts you want to take away our entertainment well we want some things then in return. Thank you for reading this rant if you made it to the end if not I don't blame you but this is been a topic that has bothered me for a long time about lockouts and how greedy and disgustingly asinine the whole process is by both sides. While we the fans sit back, lack of entertainment, still purchasing that $299.99 all stitched game worn  jersey you purchased off of Amazon. So let's fight back with both of them and demand lower ticket prices lower concession prices lower merchandising prices so that people in a struggling economy can afford to enjoy the entertainment of sporting events without being disappointed by owners and players not agreeing on certain things and destroying our hopes of having a source of entertainment that we really need at this time of uncertainty and drastic changes.",0

Looking at his career stats, it doesnt jump out at you. it doesnt say this is a franchise level superstar that is poised to hit 40 bombs and drive in 100 rbi year in year out. 

I really dont get that contract. especially coming from the rangers who already has a good young SS in IKF. 

I mean if you are gonna spend that much, why not spend it on correa who seems like he has a higher upside not to mention signing him weakens your division rival.

"Jordan Lyles pitched well today against the spiraling Red Sox (7 IP, 5 hits, 1 run, 6 Ks), but that's far from his norm. He's surrendered 31 homers this year in 138 innings, and last year, he led the AL in ER allowed, posting a 7.02 ERA and 1.56 WHIP.

Dude got a 2-year, $16MM contract from the Rangers in 2019 because he pitched a string of 11 decent games in 2019 for the Brewers: 2.45 ERA, 1.11 WHIP in 58 innings (4.42 FIP). I wonder if they just didn't bother to look at his 8 prior seasons: 5.28 ERA, 1.46 ERA in 768 innings.

About the only consistent positive trait he has as a pitcher is control: 3.1 BB/9 career. Though, that isn't so great when you consider his 10 hits allowed per 9 innings. Not to mention, his 8.4% career swinging strike rate is terrible.

Martin Perez is another: since 2013, when he placed 6th in Rookie of the Year ballots, he's posted a 4.82 ERA and 1.50 WHIP in 929 innings. Again, he doesn't walk many batters (3.3 BB/9), but allows 10 hits per 9 innings, and career swinging strike rate is only 8.2%.",0

"I am really hating a few of the changes to the game this season!

In full disclosure, I never watched a single inning of the 2020 “season” due to the Covid nonsense…it just wasn’t real baseball IMO!

So now in the 2021 season, I’m seeing two particular changes that are really screwing up a lot of games:

1 - starting a runner at 2nd in extra innings, and

2 - playing only 7 innings in a double header “complete game”!

Extra inning games have a completely different strategy this year…and it just should not be tolerated that a team can “score a run” on nothing more than a base hit!

7 inning games? Seriously? Maybe due to Covid or some other EXCEPTIONAL reason, but not just because it’s a double header!

MLB doesn’t even schedule double headers any more…we only see them occasionally to make up postponed games!

These are professional players making more money in a season than I will in my lifetime! I think the “little fellas” can handle actually playing two regulation games on occasion when it is necessary!

How did the game get so wimpy? A reliever comes in and throws 1 inning and then supposedly can’t “work again” for a day or two?

Even the broadcasters these days make it seem like it has been such a “long game” if it lasts 3.5 or 4 hours!

Right now we are talking about our top 100 players starting out with number 100. Again this is for fun so the first group that we introduced will have arguments for and against. This is nothing serious like ESPN. So if you’re interested give us a listen! And if you listen thank you and understand this is our first one our quality can only get better!,0
First one started at 1pm today (haven't heard any news yet),0

"**The 2 Expansion Teams:**

After the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays get new ballparks, I believe that these 2 cities have the most serious plans for expansion:

Nashville Stars - (Music City Baseball Group ownership)  
[https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/](https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/)

Portland Pioneers - (Portland Diamond Project Group ownership)  
[https://portlanddiamondproject.com/](https://portlanddiamondproject.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**MY NEW REALIGNMENT FOR 2028:**

With 32 teams, there would be 8 4-team divisions in realignment. The Rays and Rockies would swap leagues to make the geography better.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMERICAN LEAGUE**

|**AL EAST**|**AL NORTH**|**AL SOUTH**|**AL WEST**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baltimore Orioles|Chicago White Sox|Colorado Rockies|Los Angeles Angels|
|Boston Red Sox|Cleveland Guardians|Houston Astros|Oakland Athletics|
|New York Yankees|Detroit Tigers|Kansas City Royals|Portland Pioneers|
|Toronto Blue Jays|Minnesota Twins|Texas Rangers|Seattle Mariners|

&amp;#x200B;

**NATIONAL LEAGUE**

|**NL EAST**|**NL NORTH**|**NL SOUTH**|**NL WEST**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|New York Mets|Chicago Cubs|Atlanta Braves|Arizona D' backs|
|Philadelphia Phillies|Cincinnati Reds|Miami Marlins|Los Angeles Dodgers|
|Pittsburgh Pirates|Milwaukee Brewers|Nashville Stars|San Diego Padres|
|Washington Nationals|St. Louis Cardinals|Tampa Bay Rays|San Francisco Giants|

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW REGULAR SEASON SCHEDULE FORMULA (154 Games Per Team):**

&amp;#x200B;

**Divisional Play:**

18 games each vs. all 3 division opponents = 54 games

(Three 3-Game Series Home and Three 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Non Divisional Play Within League:**

6 games each vs. all 12 non-division opponents within league = 72 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

&amp;#x200B;

**Interleague Play:**

6 games each vs. all 4 interleague opponents from 1 assigned interleague division = 24 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs. each team)

Assigned interleague divisions will rotate annually (4-year cycle). All 4 teams in a division would be assigned the same interleague division.

&amp;#x200B;

4 games vs. interleague ""natural"" rival = 4 games

(One 2-Game Series Home and One 2-Game Series Away)

Would be played on Thursday-Sunday directly after the All-Star break in Mid-July. Thursday and Friday at one ballpark and then Saturday and Sunday at the opposite ballpark.

(Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, Orioles-Nationals, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**54 games + 72 games + 24 games + 4 games = 154-game regular season**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON (12 Total Teams Qualifying):**

In my new postseason format, 12 teams (6 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

In each league, the 4 division winners plus 2 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners would be seeded #1-#4 by record. The 2 wild-cards would be seeded #5 and #6 by record.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Wild card Series (ALWCS &amp; NLWCS):**

(#3 Seed vs. #6 Seed) and (#4 Seed vs. #5 Seed)

The #1 and #2 seeds would have a bye for this round.

Best-of-3 Series. All games in series would be hosted by the #3 and #4 seeds (division winners) regardless of regular season records and played on 3 consecutive days (Monday-Wednesday) right after the end of the regular season. The #5 and #6 seeds (wild-cards) would get no home games for this round.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Divisional Series (ALDS &amp; NLDS):**

(#1 Seed vs. wild card round winner with worst regular season record)

(#2 Seed vs. other wild card round winner)

Best of 5 Series (2-2-1 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Championship Series (ALCS &amp; NLCS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**World Series (WS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).",0

"Ah the lockout. After meeting for about three hours for two and a half months, they will meet Monday non stop until a deal is done. Yet, despite meeting for only three hours, they agreed to universal dh and expanded playoffs despite discussing “economic issues” as well. Impressive. Convenient they’ll get deal done it appears by mlb deadline of feb 28 for opening day. They did all this to create nba style free agency twice (one before lockout and one after football ended to create excitement for the season). And big name involved is Scott boras. How? By having max scherzer act as his puppet. Max is one of his richest players. Mlb has known their free agency has stunk so did this to be like nba. Deal has been pretty much done for months and most important people know that (sorry whit merrifield). Boras clients won’t be affected by this type of free agency since they’ll get paid big no matter what. Lesser players, good luck. This has all been a stunt to create interest in league. And puppets like Jeff passan have helped drive the narrative of the lockout. The lockout was bullshit from beginning and hope we all now know it. See everyone on opening day.",0
"Baseball for years now has become a regional sport, and in my view has never really recovered from the 1994 strike. Yes there was the McGwire/Sammy home run race and Bonds chasing Hank Aaron fueled by PEDs. However, that was 20 years ago. Before  that most casual fans could name several players on each team. Now days Mike Trout or Clayton Kershaw could walk into a restaurant anywhere outside of LA and be unrecognized. I’m ranting a bit, but does Manfred even want to compete with the NFL and NBA in terms of popularity or are the owners just happy with their TV deals, luxury boxes and revenue sharing? Did I answer my own question?

"This is looking bad for us fans. But I don't think all hope for a full (or 145+ game) season is lost. The next couple of weeks are going to be critical -- and I think the owners just accidentally showed their hand. Here's how the players can take advantage.

And really, it's nothing more than a well-executed PR campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Owners Care What We Think?**

What I'm about to propose wouldn't have made sense two weeks ago.  But a few things have happened since. Rob Manfred gave a laughable stupid press conference  -- it was so bad, the league issued a statement after to clarify his comments. A New York Times writer relayed a conspiracy theory about Scott Boras -- the bogeyman himself -- is the true driver of the players' efforts to do who-knows-what. And now, league water-carrier Jim Bowden is out there [arguing that](https://www.reddit.com/user/trioprice/draft/d4beac94-8e09-11ec-b4e4-d60d846f36c4) ""it's time for MLB players union to make the owners an overwhelming offer."" 

Taken together, it's surprising, but it really does seem that the owners care what the fans and general public think about this whole thing.  This isn't like previous labor impasses where the owners have basically not cared all that much about what fans think or want; they seem to really be concerned that their reputations will be harmed if this continues. Or, more specifically, they seem to understand that die-hard fans understand that this is a unilateral lockout. The owners want us to come around on that, and they want more casual fans to not come to realize that this is a one-sided stoppage. 

And that gives the MLBPA a golden opportunity. One they can very easily seize.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Players Have Messaging Power**

This isn't 1994-5. The players have a direct conduit to fans via Twitter and Instagram and, if they want, TikTok and even reddit. We've seen some organic coordination (the widespread shift to silhouetted avatars on Twitter) and some one-off tweets from players, but we haven't seen a real or coordinated messaging campaign.  

That's the good news for the players. The bad new is that the nuts and bolts about the labor issues are, well, boring and technical. Ending service time manipulation, redoing draft pick compensation, estimating league revenues to determine what a cap/tax should look like, fair wages for minor leagues, etc. -- unless you're a real baseball geek, you don't care. The players need to fight the PR battle without fighting the economic battle.

Here's how to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Message? #UnlockAndPlayBall**

Next week, the players should all show up at their training sites, roughly speaking. Flood Arizona and southern Florida. Wear team t-shirts if you're allowed to (or even better, if you're not; make the teams sue you to take them off). Go to public parks and play catch. Sign autographs. Take pictures and post them to social media. The message on every single touchpoint -- even on the signed baseballs, if you want to go a bit overboard -- should be simple: 

&gt;The fans want us on the field.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to be there.  
&gt;  
&gt;\#UnlockAndPlayBall

Hold press conferences and make it clear: we're in town, we're ready to play, and pitchers and catchers will report the second we're allowed to. And then, toss in the dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Threaten to End the Talks -- But Offer to Make a Resolution Easier**

The owners made a major mistake: they offered to involve federal mediators, if the union agreed. This was an empty offer; they knew the MLBPA would reject it and the owners believed, correctly at the time, that they'd get a PR win out of it. But now -- if the MLBPA adopts my plan above or a similar one -- the offer gives the MLBPA a weapon. The MLBA should agree to involve a mediator only (a) if the owners end the lockout and (b) starting August 1.

It's a brutal combination. The players would be asserting their willingness to negotiate provided that the owners don't ruin the season, which would resonate with fans. (And again, surprisingly, the owners care what fans think this time.)  And second, the players would be choosing a date that was very fan-friendly -- it would, effectively, guarantee a full season, as there's no way the owners would reinstate the lockout weeks before their payday, AKA the playoffs and World Series.

&amp;#x200B;

**It's a Trap (but in a Good Way)**

This strategy effectively traps the owners. They can't turn down the mediation they already offered, and they can't claim that the dispute is two-sided because the players will have made it clear that they're willing to play ball if allowed to. Further, they can't just try again next year, because *the same plan will still work.* If the owners want a resolution, they have two options: make concessions or take the players up on the unlock-and-mediate offer. The owners will have to come to the bargaining table.

"It's starting to look more and more like another BS asterisk season. The problem with this is the ""why"" people watch baseball. If your team sucks for example, you want to see prospects and rookies play well, you cheer for individual achievements etc..  if you team is in the developmental contending stage, every game feels very important, you don't care how they get the Ws you just need em... and then there are the good teams that you expect to win every night and constantly.worry if they have enough pieces for the title run... what these weird reduced seasons , covid BS does is make it all less relevant, less important, no one really cares and there are asterisks everywhere. Being from Toronto M self, last time my team was competitive 1994 happened and that set the team back about 20 years. Here we are again my Blue Jays looking like a force and woops ...rug pull.

"Justin Morneau .321/.375/.559 34 HR, 130 RBI

* After a June 7th loss the Twins fell to 25-33 and 11.5 games behind the Tigers in the AL Central. Earlier in the day Twins manager Ron Gardenhire benched his first baseman who was hitting .237, but Morneau would bounce back by hitting .362 with 23 homers and 92 RBIs over his final 104 games as the Twins went 71-33 in those starts to take the AL Central. Morneau’s 130 RBIs placed second in the AL. Funny enough, Morneau was never was in the top four hitters of the Twins lineup in 2006. 

Derek Jeter .343/.417/.483 14 HR, 97 RBI, 118 R, 214 H, 34 SB

* 2006 was the closest Derek Jeter came to winning an MVP, and it didn’t help with fans that his only runner-up finish was in one of the tightest votes ever. Jeter matched Joe Mauer at the AL batting lead at .346 with a first inning single on the final day of the season, but would go on hitless the rest of the day to finish second at .343. The Yankees led the AL with 97 wins and 930 runs scored, and Jeter provided a lot on offense. His .381 AVG with RISP ranked third in the AL and ranked sixth with a .369 AVG with two-outs and RISP. Jeter finished second in AVG and runs, third in hits, and fourth in OBP. On the basepath, Jeter's 34 stolen bases was the seventh most in the league, but he got caught only five times and his 87.1% stolen base rate was the third best. Only three other middle infielders even found themselves listed on a ten player MVP ballot by one of the 28 voters.

David Ortiz .287/.413/.636/1.049 54 HR, 137 RBI, 115 R, 119 BB

* After finishing as the AL MVP runner-up in 2005, Big Papi may have had the best season of his career in 2006. Ortiz led the league in home runs, RBIs, walks and total bases, while finishing second in both SLG and OPS. The only player to be a prominent  DH and win the MVP was Don Baylor in 1979, and that hurt Ortiz’s case. After having the division lead the entire month of July the Red Sox finished 23-34 to fall to third in the division and miss the playoffs for the first time since 2002. Yet Ortiz hit 17 home runs with a 1.127 OPS over the final two months when the Red Sox’s season fell apart.

Frank Thomas .270/.381/.545 39 HR, 114 RBI

* In his 17th MLB season, The Big Hurt spent his first outside the White Sox as he signed with the Oakland A’s. Thomas, a full-time DH now only started 135 games and never saw the field. Oakland won the division and was 79-56 with Thomas in the lineup card and 14-23 when he wasn’t. The two-time MVP finished fifth in home runs and eighth in RBIs.

Jermaine Dye .315/.385/.622/1.006 44 HR, 120 RBI, 103 R, 74 XBH, 335 TB

* The reigning World Series MVP had the best season of his career in 2006. Dye finished second in home runs, third in slugging and total bases, and fifth in OBP, RBIs, and extra-base hits. Dye was an RBI machine and hit .351 with a .716 SLG in 178 PA with RISP. The White Sox missed the playoffs but still managed to win 90 games and their offense led by Dye scored the third most runs in the league (86). 

Joe Mauer .347/.429/.507 13 HR, 84 RBI, 86 R, 79 BB

* Mauer became the first catcher in history to win the AL Batting Title and led all catchers in every offensive rate. Mauer hit .408 with a 1.200 OPS in 64 PA with two-outs and RISP.  A highlight included a five game stretch in June where he became the first player in nine years to reach base four times in five straight games. Mauer was seen as one of the better defensive catchers in baseball and helped the Twins pitching staff that gave up the second lowest run total in the AL. As the Twins won the AL Central it was unclear who their MVP was Morneau, Mauer or Johan Santana.

Johan Santana 2.77 ERA, 19-6, 0.99 WHIP, 233.2 IP, 245 K

* The Twins were second in the AL with both a 3.96 ERA and allowing 683 runs, as they’re offense ranked below league average by scoring 801 runs. Santana won his second unanimous Cy Young Award in the past three seasons -- and probably should have in 2005. Santana led the league in many categories by huge margins over there second place finishers ERA (2.77 to 3.19), WHIP (0.997 to 1.100), K (245 to 202), K/9 (9.4 to 8.4), IP (233.2 to 223.0), AVG (.216 to .241), OBP (.258 to .279), and OPS (.618 to .653). This dominance led the AL with a 7.6 bWAR, which helped the Twins win the AL Central by one game.

Travis Hafner .308/.439/.659/1.097 42 HR, 117 RBI, 100 R, 100 BB, 129 G

* The third exclusively designated hitter to finish top ten in the MVP voting Travis Hafner was arguably baseball’s best hitter in 2006. A broken hand in earlier September held Hafner to 129 games played on the season, limiting his chance to win the award. In statistical rates Hafner finished first in OBP and OPS while second in slugging. And despite his missed time Hafner finished third in home runs, four in walks and sixth in RBIs. Hafner’s six grand slams in 2006 is a single-season MLB record. 

Grady Sizemore .290/.375/.533 28 HR, 76 RBI, 134 R, 92 XBH, 22 SB, 190 H, 349 TB

* The 23 year-old centerfielder led the league in runs, doubles, and extra-base hits. While playing every game in 2006 Sizemore proved to be one of the best all-around players in the game with his defense and base-running, which led him to lead the AL with a 7.9 fWAR and finish second with a 6.7 bWAR. With Hafner’s big season and Cleveland only going 80-82 many voters put Sizemore down on their ballot.

"A player’s strike in April lasted 13 days and teams missed between six and nine games. Those games were not made up, meaning teams would play a different amount across the board. But the NL would have an MVP debate led by members of their Pennant winner and their worst team. All top five finishes were in their prime and eventually went to Cooperstown.

Johnny Bench .270/.379/.541 40 HR, 125 RBI, 100 BB

* In 1970 Johnny Bench would become the first catcher to ever lead a league in home runs, and he did it again in 1972 -- the next catcher to do so would be Salvador Perez tied for the AL lead in 2021. The big Red Machine won and went 95-59 and their 707 runs scored was the second most in the NL (one run behind the Astros). Bench was one of the main reasons for the output leading the NL with 40 HR and 125 RBIs. Being the most feared power hitter in the NL, Bench walked 100 times and led the league with 23 via intentional pass. But Bench’s true value many thought was behind the plate. Many regard Bench as the best defensive catcher ever, and in 1972 he threw out 31-56 runners attempting to steal for a league-leading 56% caught stealing.

Billy Williams .333/.398/.606/1.005 37 HR, 122 RBI, 95 R, 348 TB

* Williams was the runner-up to Bench in the 1970 NL MVP, and this would repeat itself in 1972. Williams won the batting title and also led the NL in SLG, OPS, and total bases. But Williams improved with his situational hitting with a .347 AVG with a league leading .466 OBP and .719 with RISP in 163 PA. Williams made his case for the best hitter in baseball in 1972. The future Hall of Famer helped the Cubs go 85-70, but nobody else on the team came within 20 homers or 48 RBIs of Williams. No other player in baseball had the burden of carrying his team’s offense as much as Williams in 1972.

Willie Stargell .293/.373/.558 33 HR, 112 RBI

* The NL's best record belongs to the 96-59 Pittsburgh Pirates. When Stargell was in the lineup the Pirates went 84-47, but were only 12-12 when he wasn’t starting. Stargell finished in the league’s top five in home runs, RBIs, OBP and OPS. 

Joe Morgan .292/.417/.435 16 HR, 73 RBI, 122 R, 115 BB, 58 SB

* The eventual two-time MVP would break out as one of the best players in baseball during 1972 for the Big Red Machine. Morgan led the NL in runs, walks, times on-base (282) and on-base percentage. An all-around player, Morgan had the second most stolen bases in the NL and committed only eight errors at second base for a fielding rate of 99.0%. Morgan’s situational hitting helped the Reds have the second best run output in baseball, having a .427 OBP in the 117 innings he led off in while also having a .339 AVG with RISP. A highlight for Morgan was also being named all-star game MVP when he had a walk-off single.

Steve Carlton 41 GS, 27-10, 1.97 ERA, 346.1 IP, 310 K

* Before the 1972 season, the Phillies traded for Steve Carlton by sending the Cardinals Rick Wise in what turned out to be one of the biggest lopsided trades in MLB history. In 1972 Carlton won his first of four Cy Young awards, but it didn’t matter much to the franchise as they went 59-97. That means Carlton alone was the winning pitcher for the Phillies in 27 of their 59 wins, which made 46% of his team’s wins a major league record. Of winning almost half of his team’s games Carlton said “I consider that season my finest individual achievement.” The Phillies went 29-12 when Carlton started, and went 30-85 when he didn’t take the bump. Carlton also went at least nine innings in 29 starts, and threw 30 complete games. Carlton led the NL in starts, IP, ERA, CG, K, and wins.

"There was a battle between Don Mattingly and Rickey Henderson for the most valuable Yankee with the debate centering over which is more valuable: scoring runs or driving them in and how much does base running and defense impact a game. George Brett had arguably his best season, while Wade Boggs in his fourth season raised his career batting average to .351. 

Don Mattingly .324/.371/.567 35 HR, 145 RBI, 107 R, 211 H, 86 XBH, 159 G

* Mattingly followed up a batting title and third place finish in the 1984 AL MVP, by winning the MVP in 1985. Mattingly led the league in RBIs, extra-base hits and total bases, finished second in hits, SLG and OPS and fourth in home runs. His ratio of 35 home runs to 41 strikeouts may have been the most impressive statistical feat by a hitter in 1985. The Yankees won 97 games, but it was not enough to make the playoffs as New York lost to Toronto on the season’s final day when they were trying to force a game 163 with them. Mattingly usually hit second or third in the lineup and created a devastating combo with leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson which helped the Yankees lead baseball with 839 runs scored.

George Brett .335/.436/.585/1.022 30 HR, 112 RBI, 103 BB, 108 R

* At age 32 the 1980 AL MVP may have had the best season of his twenty-one year hall of fame career. Brett led the Royals to 91 wins and the AL Central title by carrying their offense down the final week of the season. The Angels were leading the Royals by one game for the AL West entering the final eight games of the season, and Brett then went on a tier. Going 11 for 23 (.478 AVG) with five homers and 13 RBIs and eight extra-base hits over in his final seven games to take the division by a game. The Royals won four straight games to clinch the division -- with Brett homering in each -- and a highlight included hitting a two-run home down four runs in the sixth inning of game 161 to start a comeback rally to clinch the division. Brett’s situational hitting was exceptional hitting .340 with a .514 OBP with RISP in 218 PA, and those numbers rose to a god-like .396 AVG, .623 OBP and 1.103 OPS with two-out and RISP in 77 PA. Overall Brett led the AL in SLG and OPS, while finishing second in AVG and OBP while hitting a career-best 30 home runs and 103 walks. 

Rickey Henderson .314/.419/.516 24 HR, 146 R, 72 RBI, 80 SB, 99 BB, 143 G

* In his first season as a Yankee, Rickey led the league in runs and stolen bases, was third in OPS and fourth in AVG and OBP. His 146 runs were the most since 1950 and he became the first player since Jimmy Foxx in 1939 to score more runs than games played (nobody has done it since). Rickey set a Yankees all-time record in stolen bases and became the first 20/80 player ever as he hit 24 HR and had 80 SB. Rickey’s OBP was 48 points higher than Mattingly while his slugging was 51 points below. Rickey himself believes he lost the MVP by having a great start to the season and not finishing as well, he had a .357 AVG and .993 OPS before the all-star break, but those numbers fell to .270 and .875 in the season’s second half. His defense at center field was exceptional as total zone rating has him saving 13 runs on the year. Thus, his 9.9 bWAR and 9.7 fWAR both led the league showing his all-around game’s value.

Wade Boggs .368/.450/.478, 8 HR, 78 RBI, 107 R

* Boggs’ 758 PA was the sixth most ever in a season, and he combined that with impressive statistical rates by winning the batting title and leading the league in OBP and finishing fourth in OPS. Boggs’ 240 hits were the eleventh most in a single-season and the most since 1930, while his 340 times on-base was the eight most ever and most since 1949. The one down-side was his power with only eight homers and 53 extra-base hits. Boggs’ 187 singles would be the second most in the twenty century, as only Lloyd Warner in 1927 would have more.

I grew up watching the mid 2000s badass Cleveland Indians and man, pronk was a beast. He tied the MLB record with six grand slams in a season in 2006. Led the AL in SLG and OPS that year, hitting .308, 42 hrs, 117 RBI MVP numbers, but not even an all star.",0

I think this whole lockout is staged so mlb had “nba style” free agency before and after. A good week to have that nba style free agency would be super bowl bye week. Good opportunity to seize sports headlines along with that would allow no spring training games to be missed. I’m not sure if mlb owners and players have been negotiating secretly or what but I think deal is about done.

"2000 NL MVP

The 2000 MVP was a close finish by two Giants teammates, and Barry Bonds would be the runner-up before winning four straight MVPs. Todd Helton came the closest anyone has come to hitting .400 since Ted Williams. 

Jeff Kent .334/.424/.596 33 HR, 125 RBI, 90 BB, 114 R

* The Giants cleanup hitter was put in positions to deliver with men on, as Barry Bonds would hit the spot before Kent and produce a .440 OBP with a league-leading 117 walks. With men on-base, Kent slashed .382/.482/1.114 helping Bonds score the most runs of his career. The second baseman led all NL middle infielders in homers, RBIs, OBP, BB and SLG as the Giants 925 runs still to this day ranks second in franchise history since the start of the twentieth century. Giants manager Dusty Baker chose Kent as his pick. Bonds said of Kent’s season, “The numbers he puts up for a second baseman are amazing. They're great for any player, but to do it at second base is really something.” 

Barry Bonds .306/.440/.688/1.127 49 HR, 106 RBI, 129 R, 117 BB

* Bonds was already a three-time MVP, but hadn’t won the award since 1993. His RBI total may not seem high for a player with 49 home runs, but pitchers feared Bonds adding a lot to their numbers. 73 of his league-leading 117 walks were with men on-base, giving him a .519 OBP in those moments and leaving Kent with important at-bats. Bonds was becoming more powerful than ever with a career-high in home runs and slugging. Game of Shadows would report that Bonds started using steroids after the 1998 season and with an injury-plagued season in 1999, 2000 was the first year Bonds would see the results of his new physique. 

Mike Piazza .324/.398/.614 38 HR, 113 RBI, 90 R

* Mike Piazza had his best season as a Met in his hall of fame career. He led the catches in home runs, RBIs, total bases, batting average and slugging. The Mets won 94 games and took the wild card. Piazza may have been higher on this list had he started more than 129 games. New York was far better with Piazza in the lineup going 76-53 with him, and only 18-15 without him.

Jim Edmonds .295/.411/.583 42 HR, 108 RBI, 129 R, 103 BB

* In his first year in St. Louis Edmonds set career-highs in just about every offensive category. Already known as one of the best defensive center fielders ever, Edmonds helped the Cardinals stay afloat and win the NL Central with a 96-67 record as Mark McGwire missed 73 games. 

Todd Helton .372/.563/.698/1.162 42 HR, 147 HR, 138 R, 59 2B, 103 XBH, 103 BB, 216 H

* In the middle of an August 21st game, Helton’s AVG was .400 (178 H/ 447 AB) becoming the first player since Ted Williams in 1941 to be a qualified hitter and reach the mark. Helton could have got injured or decided to sit out the rest of the season and make history. While Helton couldn’t sustain the .400 his season was impressive. The Rockies first baseman led the league in hits, doubles, RBIs and total bases. Along with 42 home runs and 103 walks. Helton’s 103 XBHs were tied for the most in a single-season since 1930. Helton became the first player since 1937 and only the fifth ever to produce a 200 hit, 40 HR, 100 RBI, 100 R, 100 XBH, 100 BB season -- and the fifth player ever joining Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Fox and Hank Greenberg. Helton also became the seventh player to lead the league in the AVG, OBP, and SLG since World War II. But many voters held it against Helton that his numbers were inflated because he played at the mile-high Coors Field. In 1999 his teammate Larry Walker also led the league in AVG, OBP and SLG. Helton home numbers were huge in 81 games having a .391 AVG, 1.242 OPS, 27 HR, 92 R, with 88 RBIs. but his road numbers also could have kept him in the MVP race alone, having a .353 AVG, 1.071 OPS, 15 HR, and 59 RBI. Helton led the NL with a 8.9 bWAR and 8.3 fWAR. The Rockies finished 82-80, but with the best offense in the NL scoring 969 runs.

Vladimir Guerrero .345/.410/.664 44 HR, 123 RBI, 101 R, 197 H

* The 2000 Expos had the third worst record in baseball, going 67-95 but Guerrero may have been the one bright spot. His league leading 23 intentional walks proved many pitchers would rather face the rest of the Expos lineup than go up against Vlad. Still Vlad managed to set franchise records in home runs and batting average. This season is likely the best by a position player in Montreal history, as Vlad also is arguably the best player in Expos history.

Jeff Bagwell .310/.424/.615/1.039 47 HR, 132 RBI, 152 R, 107 BB

* Still to this day, Bagwell’s 152 runs scored are the most since 1936. Bagwell had a .487 OBP in the 113 innings he led off in and a .460 OBP when zero-outs. His 295 runs over a two years span (99-00) is the most in NL history. Despite the Astros scoring 938 runs, the pitching staff gave up 944 and the team finished 72-90. Bagwell had the best full season of his hall of fame career with a career-high 47 homers. 

Andrew Jones .303/.366/.541 36 HR, 104 RBI, 122 R, 199 H

* Jones was seen as the best defensive player in baseball as he roamed center field, as total zone rating had him saving 25 runs in 2000. At only twenty-three years old Jones set what would be his career-highs in runs scored, batting average, and hits. The Braves won 95 and the NL East, and Andrew was now considered the best Jones on the Braves as he outperformed the reigning MVP Chipper. 

Gary Sheffield .325/.438/.643 43 HR, 109 RBI, 105 R, 101 BB

* Sheffield had a big season at the plate in 2000, ranking third in the NL in OBP and OPS, and fourth in SLG. Sheffield also hit .357 with a 1.135 OPS with RISP. His case for the award fell as he was a well below outfield and baserunner. He committed 10 errors in left field and was caught stealing in six of ten attempts. 

Sammy Sosa .320/.406/.634 50 HR, 138 RBI, 106 R

* Although he hit 60+ home runs three times in his career, 2000 was the only season where Sosa led the league. But the Cubs had another rough season in 2000 losing 97 after losing 95 in 1999.

"2003 AL MVP was probably the wildest race in baseball history. Not only was it one of the closest, but it featured TEN different players getting a first place vote -- there are only 28 votes. Alex Rodriguez won his first of three MVPs after narrowly missing out on the award numerous times.

Alex Rodriguez .298/.396/.600/.995 47 HR, 124 R, 118 RBI, 161 G

* A-Rod was probably better each of the previous three seasons. But this was still his peak A-years. Playing his final season in Texas and at shortstop (he would be traded to the Yankees), the best player in baseball centered around Bonds, Rodriguez and Pujols. But he had yet to win an MVP, while finishing second in both 1996 and 2002 (both likely should have been his) and already had arguments for winning in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Alex led the AL in HRs, Runs, and slugging. He led the AL in both bWAR (8.4) and fWAR (8.4). But only Andre Dawson in 1987 had won an MVP on a last place team before. The Rangers finished 71-91. But the real reason they finished last in the AL West was because their pitching staff finished with a 5.67 ERA, easily the worst in all of baseball. Texas’ pitching staff performed so poorly that the 969 runs they gave up was the third most by a team since 1940. The day he was named MVP A-Rod told ESPN “It's been a rough three years in Texas.”

Carlos Delgado .302/.426/.593/1.019 42 HR, 145 RBI, 109 BB

* Delgado had the biggest offensive season in the AL in 2003, leading the league with a 1.019 OPS and 145 RBIs. But where Delgado really upped his game was in 219 PA with RISP, he .357/.507/.650/1.157. The Blue Jays finished a respectable 86-76 for third place in the AL East -- possibly the toughest division in baseball with the Yankees and Red Sox who would match in in the ALCS. Delgado was both average in the field and on the base path. He made a final week push for the award by hitting four home runs in a game on September 25th. After finishing second the Blue Jays star told ESPN, “Obviously, I was expecting to get the award and that wasn't the case. If they were going to pick somebody from a team that did not make it to the playoffs I think it would have given me an edge, but that's what I get for thinking, I guess.”

Jorge Posada .281/.405/.922 30 HR, 101 RBI

* The Yankees won 101 games in 2003. Derek Jeter got injured on opening day and missed a month and a half. Jason Giambi had batted .330 from 2000-2002, but fell to .250 in 2003. Bernie Williams Batting average dropped 70 points from 2002 to 2003. After Alonso Soriano finished 3rd in the 2002 MVP voting, there was a narrative that a new bunch of Yankees had arrived with veterans Paul O’Neill, Tino Martinez, Scott Brosius and Chuck Knoblauch now gone. Posada had a solid season, but catchers just usually aren’t at the top of offensive categories. With the Yankees still winning 101 games with an adjusting team in 2003, Posada was seen as the best candidate on the league’s best team. Many voters felt it was enough to win the award when there wasn’t a clear favorite. 

Shannon Stewart .307/.364/.459 13 HR, 90 R, 73 RBI

* The strangest seasons to ever finish in the top five of an MVP. Stewart never made an all-star team in his fourteen year career. In 2003, Stewart played his first 71 games with the Blue Jays and Delgado before being traded to the Twins on July 15th where he played his final 65 games. At the time Minnesota was 7.5 games behind the Kansas City Royals in the AL Central. Then Minnesota would go 44-21 with Stewart playing on their way to winning the division (48-51 without Stewart overall). The Twins also went 9-4 in August and September against the eventual 43-119 Tigers. Many voters were persuaded that Stewart was the reason for the Twins midseason surge, but prior to Stewarts arrival the Twins had an 4.74 ERA and once he arrived that staff’s ERA dropped to 3.96. But after July 17th the Twins averaged 5.3 runs per game, while before they scored at a rate of 4.5. Stewart had a decent season with the Twins slashing .322/.384/.470, but his season numbers look to be a borderline all-star.

David Ortiz .288/.369/.592 31 HR, 101 RBI, 128 G

* After a solid 2002 season, the Twins non-tendered Big Papi which led to the Red Sox signing the slugger to one year $1.25 million contract contingent that he makes the team out of spring training. Ortiz only started 117 games (73 at DH) and pinch hit in another eleven games. Only Don Baylor in 1979 was a primary DH to win an MVP. Ortiz’s 31 homers with 101 RBIs and a .961 OPS were solid, but would eventually be one of his least productive seasons in Boston. Along with Ortiz’s surprise the Red Sox won 95 games and took the Wild Card.

Manny Ramirez .325/.427/.587 37 HR, 104 RBI, 117 R, 154 G

* Manny led the AL in OBP and lost out on the batting title to teammate Bill Mueller by a single point. Manny also finished second with a 1.014 OPS. What really hurt his case was comparing him to himself. Over the previous five seasons Manny averaged 0.98 RBIs per game (664 RBIs in 667 G), while that number fell to 0.68 per game in 2003. But it was tough to see Manny’s fault with a slashline of .338/.512/.603 with RISP in 215 PA. While Manny’s offense was superb, he was seen as arguably the worst outfielder in baseball. 

Nomar Garciaparra .301/.345/.524

* Nomar looked to be firmly in the MVP race, but he had a miserable final 25 games of the season where he hit .162 with only seven extra base hits and took him out of the race. While Red Sox players finished 5th, 6th and 7th in voting it was hard to see who voters felt was the team’s MVP. Each hit well, but were seen as liabilities defensively. 

Vernon Wells .317/.359/.550 215 H, 118 R, 117 RBI, 33 HR, 87 XBH

* Wells had the best year of his career in 2003. He led the AL with 215 hits, 49 doubles, and 87 extra base hits while playing center field. Wells would go on to win deserved gold gloves, but metrics were not as kind to him in 2003. The reason for Wells finishing below where his numbers would suggest is many voters valued his teammate Delgado as the team’s MVP candidate and couldn’t wrap their mind around having two candidates on a third place team.

Carlos Beltran .307/.389/.522 26 HR, 100 RBI, 102 R, 41 SB

* The Kansas City Royals had the second lowest payroll among MLB teams in 2003, and finished 83-79 despite a weak roster. Beltran was one of the best defensive players and base runners in baseball. His total zone rating had him saving 15 runs in center field and his 41 SBs in 45 attempts gave him the highest SB% (91.1) in the AL. Beltran’s game had zero weakness, and was among the very all-around players in the game.

Brett Boone .294/.366/.535 35 HR, 117 RBI, 111 R, 75 XBH

* After losing out on the 2001 AL MVP in a very tight vote to his teammate Ichiro, Boone had another career year in 2003. His 117 RBIs led the second baseman, and his 35 HRs finished second among his position in the AL.

"The 1955 MVP was full of voting controversy as Roy Campanella edged Duke Snider. There was debate as to who was the better Dodger, who was New York’s best center fielder, and who was the best young player in baseball. Nine of the top 10 finishers in the voting found their way to Cooperstown. It was the first of roughly ten MVPs Willie Mays fans feel he was snubbed.

The race went 1) Roy Campanella 2) Duke Snider 3) Ernie Banks 4) Willie Mays 5) Robin Roberts 6) Ted Kluszewski 7) Don Newcombe 8) Stan Musial T9) Hank Aaron T9) Pee Wee Reese

Roy Campanella .318/.395/.583 32 HR, 107 RBI

* Campanella would win his third MVP of the previous five seasons. Seen as the best catcher of his era, Campanella threw out 23 of the 44 runners who attempted to steal a base off him for a caught stealing rate of 52%. Campbell only played in 123 (making 118 starts), and the Dodgers were 80 and 38 when he was in the lineup card as opposed to 18-17 when he didn’t go. Campanella was clutch with a .381 AVG and 1.097 OPS with RISP. The Dodgers won the NL pennant, and the now thirty-three year old Campanella was seen as their leader. 

Duke Snider .309/.418/.628/1.046 42 HR, 136 RBI, 126 R, 104 BB, 82 XBH

* In the 25 years since the MVP was introduced in 1931 this was the seventh time teammates finished first and second in voting in either league (there were only eight teams in each league at the time). Snider led the NL with 126 runs 136 RBIs and tied for the lead with 82 XBH, while finishing second in OBP (.418), SLG (.628), and OPS (1.046). Snider’s 42 home runs was his third consecutive season hitting at least 40 and would continue it for another two. Duke was the biggest contributor to a Dodgers offense that led the league with 857 runs scored (5.6 r/G), 96 more than any other team in the league. There was a lot of debate amongst Dodger fans and baseball fans on who was more deserving, Campanella or Snider. Controversy ensued as a story of a hospitalized voter sending a ballot listing Campanella both first and fifth without naming Snider, and instead of throwing out the ballot altogether Campanella was awarded a first place vote -- if that ballot was discarded or placed Snider in the top five he wins. The second Campanella was likely intended for his teammate. Baseball journalist Joe Posnanski discovered this later on. Bill James would say on the more deserving Dodger debate “It is pretty far-fetched to argue that Campanella was better than Snider. You would have to exaggerate his defensive value to heroic proportions.”

Ernie Banks .295/.345/.596 44 HR, 117 RBI, 98 R, 82 XBH

* Banks had his breakout year in 1954, hitting a single-season record 44 home runs by a shortstop. Banks also set a single-season record of five grand slams, going seven for twelve with two walls together with the bases loaded. Banks tied for the league-lead with 82 XBH, and was fourth with 117 RBIs. His Performance was not enough to help the lovable loser Cubs, who finished 72-81 for sixth place amongst eight teams.

Willie Mays .319/.400/.659/1.059 51 HR, 127 RBI, 123 R, 82 XBH, 24 SB

* Willie Mays is widely considered the greatest player of all-time. In 1954 he won the NL MVP and led the New York Giants to a World Series victory. 1955 Mays was just as good as any year in 21 year career. He led the NL with 51 HR, 13 3B, .659 SLG, 1.059 OPS, 382 TB and even 85.7 SB% while his 82 XBH tied for the league lead. Mays’ .319 AVG, 123 Runs, 127 RBIs, and 24 SB all ranked second in the league. His 9.1 bWAR and 9.0 fWAR all obviously led the league as Mays is considered by many the greatest center fielder of all-time -- but trying to evaluate 1950s defense is difficult today. With Mickey Mantle also at his peak in the AL New York’s three center fielder’ were future Hall of Famers Mays, Mantle, and Snider all at their apex in the 1950s. The Giants finished 80-74 for third place in the NL, while New York’s other two centerfielders played in the Yankees-Dodgers world series.

Stan Musial .319/.408/.566 33 HR, 107 RBI

* Already a three time NL MVP and three time runner-up Musial had his eight 100 RBI season and sixth 30 home run season. But as Musial played for the Cardinals for over twenty-three years, their worst season was 1955 as St. Louis went 68-86 finishing second to last in the NL.

Hank Aaron .314/.366/.540 27 HR, 106 RBI, 105 R

* In just his second season at age 21 Hank Aaron made his first all-star team in 1955 and led the league with 37 doubles. His 27 homers at him finish the season with 40 total in his career. This was also Aaron’s first 100 RBI season, he would go onto have 11 of them and still holds the most in MLB history at 2297. Aaron also started 26 games at second base, the most he would appear in the infield until the 1970s when he played first base. The Milwaukee Braves would finish second in the NL with an 85-69 record. 

Eddie Matthews .289/.413/.601/1.014 41 HR, 101 RBI, 108 R, 109 BB

* Matthews would finish 18th in NL MVP voting. Yet, he was among the best hitters and players in the NL. For the third consecutive year he hit more than 40 home runs and drove in more than 100 and became feared enough to lead the league in walks with 109. As the season uncluded, Mathews, still only twenty-three years old, had the most home runs (153) before turning twenty-four in baseball history.

"The 2011 AL MVP had a deep field, with many candidates taking the lead at various points post all-star break. Six different players received a first place vote among the 28 voters.

The race went 1) Justin Verlander 2) Jacoby Ellsbury 3) Jose Bautista 4) Curtis Granderson 5) Miguel Cabrera 6) Robinson Cano 7) Adrian Gonzalez 8) Michael Young 9) Dustin Pedroia 10) Evan Longoria

Justin Verlander 24-5, 2.40 ERA, 251.0 IP, 250 K, 0.92 WHIP

* Verlander became the first pitcher in nine seasons to win at least twenty-four games. The Tigers went 25-9 in JV’s starts, while going 70-58 when he didn’t pitch. On July 21st the Tigers were tied for the AL Central lead, and that night began Verlander's streak of winning his next twelve starts with a 2.28 ERA in 87.0 innings. The Tigers won the division by 15 games. Verlander went at least eight innings in fourteen starts and at least seven in twenty-six starts. He led the AL in Wins (24), ERA (2.40), starts (34), strikeouts (250) and WHIP (0.92). A notable moment was his no-hitter thrown on May 7th, and taking a June 14th start five outs away before finishing with a two-hit shutout. He won the AL Cy Young unanimously, and finished first in the league in bWAR (8.6) but fWAR (6.5) was far lower.

Jacoby Ellsbury .321/.376/.552 32 HR, 105 RBI, 212 H, 119 R, 39 SB

* The Red Sox center fielder won the Comeback player of the year after only playing 18 games in 2010 because of various injuries. Ellsbury had 32 homers and 105 RBIs, nearly becoming the second player in MLB history to hit the century mark from the leadoff spot alone (97 RBIs in 144 games at the top of the lineup). These impressive RBI totals were because Ellsbury hit .366 with a 1.111 OPS with RISP in 145 plate appearances (PA). Those numbers rose to a .400 AVG and 1.227 OPS in 70 PA with two-out and RISP. Playing centerfield, Elssbury was also rated well above average with 9 DRS, which helped him win his first gold glove. A speedy baserunner Ellsbury did swipe 39 bases but also got caught stealing 15 times. Ellsbury led the league in both extra-base hits (83), total bases (364), fWAR (9.5), while finishing first among position players in bWAR (8.3). The Red Sox entered September with a division lead and nine games up on the wild card, but went 7-20 to finish 90-72 and not make the postseason. Yet Ellsbury was the only bright spot in that 27 games span alashing .358/.400/.667 with 8 homers 21 RBIs, and 22 runs scored.

Jose Bautista .302/.447/.608/1.056 43 HR, 103 RBI, 132 BB

* Bautista had his best season in 2011, leading the league in home runs (43), walks (132), slugging (.608) and OPS (1.056). Bautista was also tied with Ellsbury for the lead in bWAR (8.3). But what really hurt his case was the Blue Jays finishing fourth in the AL East at 81-81 and his situational hitting. Bautista hit .245 with a .436 SLG with RISP in 110 ABs, and that may have been because he got nothing to hit because he also walked 64 for a .519 OBP in those situations. His AVG and SLG fell to .216 and .378 in 67 PAs with two-out and RISP, while his OBP went up to .567. While Bautista was clearly the best hitter in the AL, at best he was close to average in the outfield and on the base path. 

Curtis Granderson .262/.364/.552 41 HR, 119 RBI, 136 R, 25 SB

* The Yankees manager Joe Girardi said in late August that his center fielder was his MVP pick because of getting runs. Granderson led the AL with 136 runs scored (fifteen more than anyone else) and 119 RBIs. While finishing second in the league with 41 homers. From 1948 through 2010 there were 14 players who led their league in both runs scored and runs batted in, and 11 won MVP (along with Kemp in the NL, it happened in both leagues during 2011 and neither won MVP). Granderson played a premium position at a solid level, and helped the Yankees take 97 games and the AL East title. Even though he led the league in RBIs, he left many on the table in the Yankees lineup slashing .242/.303/.516 with RISP in 188 PA and .208/.266/.389 with two-out and RISP in 78 PA. In his final 35 games he had a .188 AVG as New York clinched the division. 

Miguel Cabrera .344/.448/.586/1.033 30 HR, 105 RBI, 108 BB, 197 H

* In 2011 Miguel Cabrera won his first of three consecutive batting titles by leading the AL with a .344 AVG. Cabrera, playing his eighth full season in the majors,  led the league with a .448 OBP, 48 doubles and 308 times on-base. His 1.033 OPS finished second to Bautista. Cabrera led the AL Central winning Tigers in runs, hits, extra-base hits, homers, runs batted in and across the slash line. But at the time, many saw it as a down year for Miggy because he hit 30 home runs and batted in 105. Over his first seven full seasons he averaged 34 homers and 117 runs batted in. One may think that his situational hitting was the reason for him not driving in runs at his normal rate, but it was quite the opposite. In 2011 Miggy hit .388 with a 1.191 OPS with RISP in 197 PA, and slashed .382/.539/.724 in 102 PA with two-outs and RISP. Entering August the Tigers were 57-51 and 2.5 games up in the AL Central, then Miggy slashed .408/.491/.648 the rest of the way as the Tigers went 38-16 and won the division by 16 games.

Robinson Cano .302/.349/.533 28 HR, 118 RBI, 188 H, 81 XBH

* With Jeter, A-Rod, and Texiera past their peak, Cano was now seen as the Yankees best player, and one of the best all-around players in baseball. Cano fell one RBI (118) shy of the league lead behind his teammate. Cano’s season was also highlighted by winning the home run derby in Phoenix, and his 29 homers on the season were the third most by a middle infielder in the league. His 81 extra-base hits only trailed Ellsbury in all of baseball, and in the field he became one premier second baseman in baseball. 2011 was the second of five consecutive seasons where Cano would finish top six in the AL MVP voting.

Adrian Gonzalez .338/.410/.548 27 HR, 117 RBI, 213 H, 108 R

* The Red Sox acquired Gonzalez in the offseason prior, and it paid off immediately. Entering August first the Red Sox were leading the AL East and on pace for 100 wins (66-40) as Gonzalez at the time was leading the league with a .357 AVG and 90 RBIs looking to be the frontrunner for the MVP award. Gonzalez didn’t play badly the rest of the way, but his numbers fell and the Red Sox collapsed and didn’t make the postseason. His 213 hits were tied for the most in the AL. Gonzalez only made three errors and 12 DRS made him an elite first baseman. 

Michael Young .338/.380/.474 11 HR, 106 RBI, 213 H

* Young was proving to be one of the most consistent players of the previous decade. In 2011 he tied for the league lead with 213 hits, his sixth 200 hit season. A highlight also included his 2,000th career hit, the first player in a Rangers uniform to get there. His .338 AVG and 106 RBIs were career highs. His .377 AVG with RISP were a huge help to the Rangers lineup, as for the first time in his career Young was the Rangers’ primary cleanup hitter (starting 89 games fourth in the lineup). In 2004 Young moved from 2B to SS for the acquisition of Alfonso Soriano, then to 3B in 2009 for the arrival of Elvis Andrus, and now in 2011 to DH after signing Adrian Beltre. Young’s consistency in the lineup was important for the 96-win Rangers, as Nelson Cruz, Josh Hamilton and Beltre all missed significant time due to injury. Yet, his defensive versatility was just as important as he started games at each infield spot (39 at 3B, 36 at 1B, 14 at 2B, 1 SS).

Dustin Pedroia .307/.387/.474 21 HR, 91 RBI, 102 R, 26 SB

* The 2008 AL MVP had arguably his best season in 2011, hitting a career-high 21 home runs. Being one of the best middle infielders in baseball, Pedroia finished 3rd in both bWAR (8.0) and fWAR (7.9) among AL position players. After a disappointing first two months of the season, Pedroia would get hot with a .342 AVG and .959 OPS in his final 104 games. Between the Red Sox miserable September and many MVP candidates on the team Pedroia fell in the race.

Evan Longoria .244/.355/.495 31 HR, 99 RBI

* The most memorable moment of the season -- and one of the best in baseball history -- was Longoria's walk-off home run against the Yankees on the season’s final day to clinch the Wild Card. Longoria’s eight inning three run blast also helped the Rays comeback from a seven-run deficit in game 162. Longoria struggled with injuries and had his worst season in his then four year year career, but still finished with 31 homers and 99 RBIs. Also due to his exceptional play at third base, Longoria finished 7th in the AL with a 7.2 bWAR.

"The 2007 NL MVP was full of debate with many players representing different arguments such as counting stats vs rate statistics, hitters ballpark, home runs and RBIs vs all-around production.

The Race went 1) Jimmy Rollins 2) Matt Holliday 3) Prince Fielder 4) David Wright 5) Ryan Howard 6) Chipper Jones 7) Jake Peavy 8) Chase Utley 9) Albert Pujols 10) Hanley Ramirez

Jimmy Rollins .296/.344/.531 778 PA, 129 R, 212 H, 30 HR, 94 RBI, 88 XBH, 41 SB

* Rollins was the Phillies leader. The Phillies were down seven games in the NL East race to the Mets with seventeen games remaining, then the Phillies went 13-4 and won the division on the season’s final day. Rollins was seen as the best glove at shortstop in baseball, and won his first gold glove. Although he was seen as clutch, his OPS fell over those final seventeen games. His clutch narrative continued as many pointed out he almost had 100 RBIs (he had 94) from the leadoff spot (he started 139 games leadoff and the other 23 in the three-hole). Rollins hit .272 with RISP and that dropped to .239 with two out and RISP. Many loved to point out that Rollins had a 20-20-20-20 season (20 HRs, 20 2B, 20 3B, 20 SB), as both Rollins and Curtis Granderson became the third and fourth player ever to do so and the first since Willie Mays did 50 years prior. But Rollins' season can be summed up as a compiler. He set the all-time single season plate appearance record being up 778 times. And his league leading 139 runs were helped out by 2006 MVP Ryan Howard and Chase Utley hitting behind him.

Matt Holliday .340/.405/.607 36 HR, 137 RBI, 120 R, 216 H,92 XBH

* Holiday led the league in AVG (.340), hits (216), doubles (50), extra-base hits (92), RBIs (137), and total bases (386). While Holliday’s numbers were remarkable, many loved to point out the Coors field effect. Holliday's batting average dropped 75 points on the road (.376 to .301), his slugging dropped 237 points (.722 to .485) and his OPS dropped 297 points (1.157 to .860). He also had 25 homers in Denver compared to 11 everywhere else. This led many to believe Holliday was a solid player, but Coors field made him an MVP candidate. While many were focused on the historically hitter friendly park, holiday was clutch down the stretch. The Rockies won 12 of their final 13 games -- including a game 163 against the Padres for the wild card -- to make the postseason. In that stretch Holliday slashed .442/.532/.846/1.378 with five homers, 17 RBIs, and 16 runs. Holliday was seen as nothing special in the outfield, while his base running made for a heated debate after a walk run scored in game 163 where replays showed he didn’t actually touch the plate. 

Prince Fielder .288/.395/.618 50 HR, 119 RBI, 90 BB

* Prince a league leading 50 home runs in 2007, and along with his dad Cecil became the first father-son duo to have a 50 homer in major league history. But Fielder didn’t rate well beyond the plate and had a low WAR -- bWAR (3.6) and fWAR (4.7) -- for someone who was as productive as he was at the plate. Meaning he was miserable everywhere else. The Brewers finished 83-79, and he was often overshadowed during the season by his teammate Ryan Braun, the NL Rookie of the Year winner.

David Wright .325/.416/.584, 30 HR, 107 RBI, 34 SB

* The Mets blowing a seven game division lead with seventeen games left probably cost Wright the MVP award. Voters couldn’t see themselves awarding a player who let his team sink when it mattered most. Yet, Wright was phenomenal in those final seventeen games hitting .397 with a 1.027 OPS. For his ability at third base and stealing 34 bases Wright was becoming known as possibly the best all-around player in baseball. Wright became the third 30-30 HR-SB player in Mets history. He led the NL in fWAR (8.4) and finished second to Albert Pujols in bWAR (8.3). Wright even upped his game with runners on base, hitting .332 with a 1.004 OPS. Wright didn’t lead the league in any offensive category which made his stats seem less eye-popping, but was near the top of every category. Although his team’s position hurt his award chances, he was still on a second place team that won 88 games.

Ryan Howard .268/.392/.584 47 HR, 136 RBI

* Howard was the reigning NL MVP winner. 2007 was the only season from 2006 through 2009 where Howard didn’t lead the league in RBIs, falling an RBI shy of Holiday for the title. While his 47 homers, 136 RBI and .976 OPS were impressive most saw Howard -- like Fielder -- as a liability everywhere else. His 2.9 bWAR and 3.2 fWAR suggest he didn’t lead the Phillies to the division title. 

Chipper Jones .337/.425/..604/1.029 29 HR, 102 RBI, 134 G

* At age 35 Chipper led the NL in OPS at 1.029 and fell three points shy of Holliday for the batting title. He broke the century mark in both runs (108) and RBIs (102), and his bWAR of 7.6 ranked among the top of baseball. Had Chipper not missed 28 games and done better than a .241 AVG in 54 ABs in two-outs and RISP he may have won the award.

Jake Peavy 2.54 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 240 K, 19-6 

* Peavy won the NL Cy Young award unanimously. Leading the league with 19 wins, 240 strikeouts, 1.06 WHIP and a 2.54 ERA. But with the season on the line in a game 163 tiebreaker, Peavy didn’t win his 20th game and instead gave up six runs in 6.1 IP. Along with another start in September where he gave up eight runs, Peavy could have helped the Padres clinch a playoff spot and failed to do so. With a 2.10 ERA on september 1st, Peavy was in the MVP race.

Chase Utley .332/.410/.566 103 RBI

* Overshadowed by two other MVP winning teammates, Utley was the Phillies best player in 2007 when on the field. Had a hit by pitch not broken his hand at the end of July causing him to get surgery and miss over a month Utley would have been firmly at the top of the debate. 

Albert Pujols .327/.429/.568 32 HR, 103 RBI

* In 2006 Pujols finished second in a controversial MVP vote. And 2007 saw him not even enter the MVP race due to setting career-lows in his seventh season of home runs (32), RBIs (103), runs (99), and XBH (71). He had the second lowest AVG of his career (.327) and OPS (.997) while leading the league grounding into double plays with 27. The reigning World Champion Cardinals went 78-84. It got so bad that his own manager Tony La Russa even left him on the bench the entire all-star game, as if so many other players had passed him making it difficult to find a moment for him to be on the field with baseball’s best. The Machine wasn’t happy about his time on the bench. Pujols also led the NL in bWAR (8.7) and was second in fWAR (7.7). His numbers across the board were MVP caliber, just not at the level of his usual argument for greatest right-handed hitter ever. Pujols would go on to win the MVP the next two years. 

Hanley Ramirez .332/.386/.562 125 R, 212 H, 29 HR, 83 XBH

* The 2006 NL Rookie of the Year proved to be one of the game's best players in 2007. The shortstop was stuck on the 91 loss Marlins but still had a monster season. And he would eventually finish second in the 2009 MVP. 

**My ballot 1) Wright 2) Pujols 3) Holliday 4) Chipper 5) Peavy 6) Rollins 7) Tulowitzki 8) Beltran 9) Hanley 10) Fielder**

"2000 AL MVP had one of the deepest ballots (ballots include 10 players) we’ll ever find in a race

1. Jason Giambi 2) Frank Thomas ) A-Rod 4) Carlos Delgado 5) Pedro Martinez 6) Edgar Martinez 6) Manny Ramirez 8) Darin Erstad 9) Nomar Garciaparra 10) Derek Jeter

Breaking down each player

Giambi .336/.476/.647/1.123 OPS with 43 HRs, 137 RBI and 137 BB

* Led the A’s to 91 wins and the AL West title, Giambi had a monster season at the plate and with one of the best seasons ever in the batter’s box. This made his argument for and against are straight forward. Giambi was the catalyst offensively for a team that scored 947 runs. Giambi made 148 starts and accumulated 664 plate appearances. Although he didn’t provide much on the base path or on defense (Giambi played first base and DH 24 times), there was a gap in the Batter’s box between Giambi and the rest of the field.

Thomas 328/.436/.625/1.061 43 HR, 143 RBI, 115 R, 112 BB

* Thomas was in a similar argument to Giambi. And it shows how voters viewed the award at the time, as the two took 24 of the 28. Like Giambi, Thomas was among the leaders in RBIs, HRs, BBs and putting up big numbers across the slash line. Thomas played in 159 and had 707 plate appearances for the 95 win AL Central Chicago White Sox. The Sox also baseball with 978 runs scored. The Big Hurt was the main reason with his presence in the batter’s box. Thomas though was primarily a DH with 127 starts that didn’t include fielding. Winning the MVP would make him the second primary DH to win (1979 Don Baylor)

A-Rod 316/.420/.606/1.026 41 HR, 134 R, 132 RBI, 100 BB

* Although A-Rod has said his two best seasons were 1996 and 2007, bWAR would disagree and say it was this season at 10.4. Alex played in 148 games, all starts at shortstop and only made 10 errors at the premium position with a phenomenal 98.6% fielding percentage. The Mariners won 91 games and took the wild card (although had the same record as division champ the A’s), and A-Rod carried the offense with Ken Griffey Jr. having been traded to Cincinnati before the season. It was clear this season who the best all-around player in the game was, even if there were a couple hitters slightly better. As one of the faster players in the game, Alex was also an above average base runner and led all position players in WAR. This being his contract year worked out perfectly, and A-Rod would get $252 million -- double the guarantees more than any athlete ever and worth more than the value of many MLB franchises at the time. 

Carlos Delgado .344/.470/.664/1.134 44 HR, 137 RBI, 196 H, 123 BB, 115 R

* Delgado was the one player who could truly argue that he was a better all-around hitter than Giambi. Delgado also didn’t miss a game for the Blue Jays, making all 162 starts at 1B. Turley a contender for the award in every sense, voters didn’t value knocked Delgado compared to Giambi and Thomas because the Blue Jays only went 83-79, finishing 3rd in the AL East. 

Pedro Martinez 1.74 ERA, 284 K, 11.8 K/9, 8.88 K/BB

* Pedro famously finished second in the 1999 AL MVP after two voters snubbed him from their ballot altogether. But 2000 may have been the greatest pitching season of all-time (MLB ranked it #1 in their top nine pitching seasons ever in 2009). He led all players in bWar at 11.7 and set the all-time WHIP single season record at 0.737. His 1.74 ERA was the lowest ERA during the American league DH era (still standing for a 162 game season). The entire AL’s ERA was 4.91 and Roger Clemens finished second in ERA at 3.70 proved how amazing Pedro was. The one knock on Pedro is he started only 29 games and pitched 217.0 Innings. Unfortunately voters held it against him that Boston only won 85 games, and Pedro finished with only 18 wins (deGrom would think that’s a decent amount though). 

Edgar Martinez .324/.423/.579/1.002 145 RBI

* The future Hall of Famer was in his peak years and led the league in RBIs. The DH was a huge part of the Mariners winning 91 games, and provided A-Rod nice protection by usually hitting the spot behind him at cleanup

Manny Ramirez 351/.457/.697/1.154 122 RBI 38 HR

* In his final season in Cleveland, Manny led baseball with a 1.154 OPS and the highest of his career. Manny even had more RBIs (122) than games played (118). But the games played took him out of the race, which he may have even won had he not missed 44 games due to injury.

Darin Erstad 355/.409/.541/.951 240 H, 25 HR, 100 RBI

* The only outfielder in the top ten, Erstad had 240 hits - a total that has since been only passed by Ichiro. But Erstad didn’t find many ways to get on base and had the lowest OBP of any top ten finisher. Erstad’s bWAR (8.3) does rank second on the list.

Nomar Garciaparra 372/.434/.599/1.033 21 HR, 96 RBI

* Peak Nomar had a monster year with a .372 batting average -- still the highest number of the 21st century. Playing a premium position at short also made him more valuable, but he didn’t play it well. Also he only made 136 starts do to injury dropped him down to the bottom of the top ten.

Derek Jeter .339/.416/.481/.896 119 R, 201 H

* The only player on the World Champions to appear on the list. Jeter had his third consecutive 200 hit season in 200 and played a premium position at shortstop - although not particularly well. Jeter hit well and got on base, bu didn’t have a high batting average. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Ballot 1) A-Rod 2) Pedro 3) Delgado 4) Erstad 5) Delgado 6) Giambi 7) Garciaparra 8) Thomas 9) Edgar 10) Jeter**

"So if a pitcher is ejected, like Santiago today, they confiscate his glove and sent it to the league, then what. What if the league determines he didn’t have banned item in it, just rosin like he claims?  Is he automatically suspended regardless?  Seems like one of the (many) bad  parts of the rule. If he is innocent, he was wrongly tossed from the game. Wouldn’t it be more reasonable to just take the glove/hat whatever and make them change? Then if upon official inspection suspend him?",0

"Texas guy here.  Been to 38 MLB ballparks.  Impartial.

The best rivalries are in the NL West.   

Dodgers v Giants is unbelievable. 

Padres breaking out a can on LA?    Fantastic.

Forget Cubs v Cards.  Hate the Cubs.  Born on the South Side.",0
that means a great outing with something historic happening (in this case 10 straight strike outs tying a record) but get little to no run support and the pitcher who had the great outing being the only person on his team to drive in a run.,0
"Yes they did and that is why betting on baseball is so tricky. Normally, I don't make this many bets on baseball because of that. 162 game season can make it feel like you are playing on a slot machine.

For example, The Padres are 2-6 when Lamet starts so it makes the -270 line a very poor value in terms of investment. 

Casinos know this.",0
"Where can I get that I got it for cheap but don’t look cheap jersey? Those authentic ones keep me watching from home, I’m trying to get in the bleachers at least! Thank you!",0
"Im not the type of person who thinks everybody’s number should be retired just cause they had a few good years with the team. I dont think varitek’s should be retired (i know they didnt retire it) even though he was as great of a leader as pedroia. But pedroia’s shouldve definetely been retired. 

Pedroia brought 3 championships to boston (im counting 2018 because even though he only palyed a few games he was definitely a vocal leader). In the last 100 years only Him and Ortiz can say that. I think before the injuries started he was on his way to be a sure hall of famer. 

Even before the machado injury i think he was borderline hall of famer at that point. The injuries will bring him down in the eyes of many voters just like it did to david wright so i doubt he will be voted in. I can see him make it under the veterans committee.

Pedroia was hitting like his old self prior to that injury. In my opinion he was an all star snub in 2016. The fact that he may not make the HOF should not be an excuse for the red sox to not retire his number. I know john henry will probably not let anybody wear that number without pedroia’s  permission but lets make it official. 

Pedroi’s final stats: hits 1805 BA .299 HR 140 rbi 725 in 14 seasons (12 seasons  if you dont count the last two years where he played 9 games and stats are almost the same)

So this is a two part question:

Should the sox retire pedroia’s number?

Do you think pedroi will make the HOF?",0
"Ok so we all know how most feel about tatis. But in general he’s overrated. Now let me tell you why. First, he has shown the inability to stay healthy and rather  play injured rather then get healthy and play better, while obviously it’s has clearly only effected him defensively, he’s still not playing to his full potential rhat he can/should. Secondly, it’s funny to me how “he isn’t bad at fielding he just can’t throw” is used as a decent argument but those ppl are the same ppl saying jeter is overrated STRICTLY due to his fielding(but that’s another post lol) but anyway if they player cannot throw the ball, the very first thing we learn to do on the field, then why does he deserve to be considered the best in baseball when he really isn’t. And I know y’all will say “he only made throwing errors because he was hurt”, but to that I ask, why is he playing if he’s hurt? The Padres already have a good lineup if it’s this serious that will effect him until ASG then there is clearly more wrong then what he thinks and needs the time off so a somewhat-minor injury doesn’t end in something bigger. Now lastly we have the ppl that say “ You can’t blame him for being hurt” when while yes you cannot blame the player, if he knows he is still in pain and needs time off so he stays stronger instead of further more injuring himself, ANY MANAGER will be okay with benching the player for a few days. As I see it he’s either to egotistical and arrogant to take the time he needs, or doesn’t know how to communicate/know what’s best for his body. So to wrap it up, is Tatis good, yes. Is he best currently? No is he best ever (like I’ve seen many ppl say) Not at all. But ASG worthy but still other ss’ that deserve the praise over him.",0

- Making 5 pitching changes in a game. 
- Automatic intentional walks
- The runner on second extra innings rule.
- 7 inning double headers
- paying players $400mil salaries but minor leaguers having to drive for Uber. 

Manfred is a terrible commissioner and he should resign.",0
"baseball if this happens.  So now they are checking for substances.  Fine, whatever.  But what is going to happen is a pitcher will have a no hitter late in the game and some jackass manager will try to thrown them off their game by requesting one or numerous checks by the umpires.  Or the umpire will just simply check and the next batter gets a hit.",0
I have a question for anyone who has been to spring training. How do people come back from those games with hundreds of baseballs? Just saw several people have spring training baseballs for sale online. I am very curious how they get that many.,0
"I don't understand why mlb doesn't establish a baseline rpm for each pitcher's pitch and if there's a deviation in game check them for substances.  Solves all the tension happening right now and doesn't slow the game down.

Just have an official mlb personnel go to each team and have each pitcher throw a quick pen and measure the spin rate. Then monitor in game....",0
"Look I get that checking every opportunity, every inning is ridiculous. There should be a device that shows spin rate spikes so that we can see if anything got tampered with in between. We should never see what happened to Max scherzer happen again.

There are however, pitchers like Gerrit Cole literally complaining about not being able to use foreign substance [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH72VLCcNpA&amp;ab\_channel=iTalkStudios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH72VLCcNpA&amp;ab_channel=iTalkStudios) . This is ridiculous no? Well if that is the case, if you are saying you should be allowed substance that increase your performance, might as well go all out then. Lets also have the hitters be allowed PED and steroids. That is only fair right? 

This is actually ridiculous. They are openly admitting that they are using substance to help them with their game, and they need to make an adjustment without it. HELLO? 

UNWRITTEN RULES, AND NOW THIS? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS SPORT.",0

"At an undisclosed hotel in Boone NC, I met this strange, strange man. Before I continue, I should clarify that it could have NOT been him, but given his appearance, and all of the weird breadcrumbs he gave us, I am almost certain it was him. 

I had just gotten back from the bathroom when I saw him having a conversation with the front desk worker. I didn’t think anything of it, except for the fact that my friend, let’s call them Worm, was standing up at the front desk as well. I know Worm pretty well, and their eyes were pleading with me. Though it took me a moment to realize, something was obviously wrong. I came up and stood behind the counter with my two coworkers, not entirely sure just what was wrong, until I actually heard the man speaking. He was asking our front desker, let’s call her Hannah, some very intrusive questions. He was fishing, very poorly, for her email (like, not phone number or something easy, but her email?) and saying stuff like “I’m a pretty good guy to know, just sayin’, like, if you ever wanna guy to talk to, you know, you can hit me up.” Just some basic, terrible, uncomfortable flirtatious stuff, but then it got really weird when he said something to the effect of “You can get in contact with me when you- you know, if you break up with your boyfriend, or like, if your father dies, you know, and you get some alimony or something,” (which is not something I think you collect when a relative or in-law dies?)

He was very full of himself, quite literally talking about how he went to law school, and passed with a 4.0, and oh, how he played football in Miami (which he felt the need to clarify to us foolish mortals, was in Florida.) Hannah mentioned that she wanted to go to New York, and he was just telling her all this stuff about how “You’re from Boston, you can’t go to New York, that’s where- people up there are just, they’re conniving. It’s where all the immigrants go. It’s where they end up.” And like, really messed up stuff like that. He then left, assumedly went to his car, and came back wearing a some sports beanie, holding a laminated print out, as if to impress everyone. This print out, I assume to prove to us that he went to law school, was just a paper with the first like, five U.S. amendments. He then proceeded to tell us stuff such as:

-Stay away from Lemonade because “It’ll dehydrate you.”
-“I have been around places where a lot of big movies have been filmed.”
-“I was a quarterback. You know what that is? You have to be real smart to be a QB. Its like being the director of a movie, you know, you have to know everything.”
-“My parents, real short people, are just two dumble-dees.” (Yes. Dumbledees. He then clarified that they were, and I kid you not “real dumb-dumbs.)
-Despite his opinion on lemonade, he kept talking about how he dipped, and this it would never negatively impact him. 

He was up his own butt the whole time about how smart he was, and even went on talking about how he was the Only Good Guy in the World, and that he was better than other people because he wasn’t ever going to get married(???) 
All of this talking, at the front desk of a hotel from about 10:20 till 11:10 or so. Trying so hard to impress the poor girl there. He would not go away despite her initially giving very clear signs (telling him she’s very busy, that she isn’t allowed to make friends at work, etc.) and obvious signs (in a half-joking tone telling him to go to his room, and to go away because she is busy.) 

How do I know it was him? Well, other than him saying he was a pro football player from Miami, that he went to law school, he was from North Carolina, and that he also played baseball and basketball in the past, he also just flat out looked like every image of Garrison Lassiter than came up when I punched in those keywords. Kinda tall, in his 30’s or so, indiscernible hairline, and just his face in general. Oddly enough though, he didn’t talk much about baseball, and instead went on more about football and being a lawyer who definitely worked some very serious and secret cases. 

I know you have no reason to believe this story, or believe that it was indeed Garrison, but I know it’s true. It’s a very true, very real, EXTREMELY, UNBEARABLY ANNOYING experience. This man was pretty creepy, but far worse, he was impossibly annoying and bizarre. And once again, to clarify, all of this is alleged. I know nothing about sports, or any of his affairs.

If anyone in a position to decide whether or not to keep it actually wants to they should get a 100 mile fastball in the ribs. Then the wrist. Then the leg. It’s even less actual baseball than the DH if that can be believed. And get rid of the stupid 7 inning doubleheader’s too once Covid is past. Allow expanded pitching rosters temporarily if you must but get these stupid Covid rules the heck out of the game.,0

"The Cardinals pitcher hit Bryce Harper in the face. On the very next pitch he hit Didi Gregorius in the back. He wasn't ejected. He stayed in to face the next batter, who got a hit, then the pitcher was pulled. 

The Phillies' announcers were saying that the Cardinals' manager probably wished the pitcher was ejected, because they couldn't pull him until he faced another batter. I think they referred to a need for him to face three batters in the inning. 

Why?? I couldn't understand what they were referring to, and they didn't explain it. Why couldn't they replace the pitcher as soon as they wanted to?",0

"As somebody who doesn’t follow baseball anymore, but who splurged on gamepass and had an open weekend, I decided to download the new MLB The Show 21 and give it a try. The last baseball game I played was Ken Griffery Jr Presents on N64, so it has been a while. 

Here are some of the things I learned while playing this game:

1)	I don’t know any baseball players.

When I checked the rosters, I realized I know about five baseball players who currently play the game. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised as I don’t watch baseball, but it still hit home that very few baseball players break through the sports news cycle enough to penetrate a casual sport fan’s skull. I listen to sports radio and watch football, basketball, soccer, and golf. 
When I created a player for the Road to the Show mode, I didn’t even remember which divisions were which, but I knew enough to play in the NL so I could be a true two-way player and both pitch and bat. When you create a player, you can choose their player motions which is really cool. You can choose your batting stance, pitching motion, homerun trot and celebration, and more. While I couldn’t use any current players for this without just scrolling through each option, I could choose former players. So, if I wanted to pitch like Greg Maddux and hit like Griffey, those were options on the list. Very cool!

2)	The announcing is both awesome and terrible.

When you create a player you can input your first and last name. There are an obnoxious amount of names which have the sound already recorded. Not only did my real name work awesomely and stroke my little video game ego, but Mike Hunt worked, and my personal favorite of Victor Victor Victor (first name Victor Victor, last name Victor) was also satisfying.

Of course, once you are in the game hearing these names you giggle occasionally and listen to the broadcast as the announcing team chugs on play by play. Most of it is awesome. Most of it. They will share stats and be in awe of your twenty-game hitting streak, they will wax poetic about your pitches and how it is affecting the game. They really do an excellent job.

But some of it is also baffling, and it might just be because the game is so new and there are bugs. One in particular comment has happened to me about fifty times and I am forced to scream at the tv each time. My pitcher throws roughly 85% strikes. After playing my first season I had hundreds of strike outs and a couple perfect games, and exactly ZERO walks. That doesn’t stop one of these blowhards, pretty much every game seemingly, from commenting about how my pitcher has an interesting style but unfortunately OFTEN WALKS PEOPLE. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED ONCE. REMOVE IT FROM THE ROTATION, FELLAS.

I understand with so many games and at bats everything will get repetitive, but this has been my biggest gripe.

3)	It is really user friendly.

When you first start the game you go through a tutorial of the various ways you can pitch, hit, field, etc. While some of the ways are bafflingly difficult, if you try them all you will find the way you like. I made it pretty close to the controls I remember from KGJP64, so I didn’t need to learn how to play a baseball game all over again. The difficulty can be made to scale with your skill. This makes it so the first few games are quite easy, but then things start to flow better about halfway through the season. In the end I settled on a medium difficulty and was hitting mid .300s in the minors and striking out about 10 players a game, which I think is about right. I haven’t made it to the majors yet, but when I do I will increase the difficulty one more level to make it realistic if the game doesn’t on its own.

4)	It has good pacing.

I was most concerned about how much time I would have to dedicate to a baseball game. When I played KGJP64 I would need a good half hour to play a nine-inning game. Multiply that by 160ish or whatever and I am not going to complete a season. In the Show, however, pitching a game usually takes 10-15 minutes, and playing the field and batting can be as little as 5. If you are the DH, maybe even 3. This made it so I could play a whole season in one weekend, which is awesome. It might have just been my settings or something, and of course I skipped to where my player was active only, but the pacing made this a much more enjoyable experience than I was expecting.

5)	Your player is so customizable.

Equipment, skill cards and loadouts, appearance, motions. You can be whoever you want to be game to game. I made a 5’5 switch-hitting lefty who can throw 100 and steal second every time. I made a 6’10 giant who hits a homer a game and throws exclusively knuckle pitches. I made me, as I am unfortunately neither of those people. And you can change from your speed pitching to your power hitting to your base running to your curve throwing to your fielding guru all from game to game. This made Road to the Show a really enjoyable time.

6)	Who the fuck is Christopher Russo and why won’t he shut the fuck up?

So, when you are drafted you get these MLB Network segments that are broad enough to make it seem like they are talking about you. Just like the announcing, they aren’t always perfect but they are a good listen at least the first time through. Then there is the Christopher Russo dude who just seems like a prick who likes being a prick. I skip him every time now.

Shut the fuck up, Christopher Russo. Shut the fuck up.


In short, even as somebody who no longer follows baseball, MLB the Show 21 is a particularly good time. By playing I have learned some new players and when I get to the majors I will probably see who the stars are and it may even help me get back into the game. While I only play the Road to the Show mode, I unlocked a bunch of players which I can only assume are for some kind of Ultimate Team online mode. I might take a look at that mode, but I am wary. I have yet to bounce a curve ball two feet in front of the plate because I am not an asshole and the computer wouldn’t swing at it anyway, and I have a feeling online will be mostly that. But, even so, I think The Show will stay in my gaming rotation for a while.",0

"I'm planning to make the trip to Fenway in September for my first (and perhaps last) baseball game there.

Seeking opinions here: if you could only see a game at Fenway one time, would you pay extra to see the rivalry? Is there something else I should be considering?

"Hey All. I'm a New England guy (northern New England), and like most people from northern New England, I love the Red Sox and hate the Yankees. I've long wanted to follow a National League team, but I've never been able to pick one. 

The closest NL team is the New York Mets, which isn't terrible, but it's kind of weird to root for a New York team when I'm an all-Boston-sports guy. The next closest team is the Phillies. The Blue Jays are closer than most of the other teams (other than those mentioned previously), but that's an AL team. The Expos would have been only a few hours away, but they no longer exist. My grandmother, a big baseball fan, grew up a Boston Braves fan, so Atlanta has always been interesting, but they are really far away, obviously, and aren't on TV locally anymore (since the end of the TBS deal).

So, I guess the teams that make the most sense (which isn't saying much, I know) are the Mets and Phillies, because they are somewhat within driving distance, the Braves, and at that point, it's really a toss-up. Any ideas, thoughts, opinions? Any other recommendations? 

I know it's a weird question, but if you can't ask this sort of thing here, then where the heck can you?",0

After a team gets 3 hits in a row they're should be a fun ball time! The ump throws out the 2020 funballs and the pitcher has to use those until he gets an out. Like a bonus or something. And if a pitcher strikes out 3 in a row he's allowed to bean the first batter in the next inning he pitches....with them announcing they used 2 different weighted balls its already there. Also lets do universal DH and that player can use steroids and Adderall.,0
"Basically, I wonder if any given batter has a better chance of getting hit in their first try against the same pitcher or in a second or third go-around until the bullpen comes in.

I can't find anything here or on pro baseball reference that points to it and that could really be interesting to prove or disprove whether it's better to pull a starter on the first cycle of the batting order once a certain number of hits are on the board.

Off the top of my head, I feel as if it has to rise cumulatively as the hitter gets more used to the pitch selection but this could be one of those counterintuitive things where they actually do better on the first frame.",0

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

Career highlight: going back to back with his dad. 

Best season (1997): .304/.382/.646, 185 hits,  56HRs, 147RBIs, 15SBs

Fun feat: Griffey was the first member of the HoF to hit 40 homers in both the AL (Mariners) and NL (Reds)

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it’d be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player. If you had the blessing of watching him you knew there was never a boring moment. Iconic is the word to describe him.

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game.

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today.

I'm a Mets fan and I remember being excited when he signed.  He played great....then they traded him back to the Dodgers.  I know the team stunk and they were dumping everyone.  How on earth did he clear waivers, someone on a 1 year deal hitting over .300 at the time?",0

Trout 176
Ted Williams 191

Based on career averages right now, he’s still significantly worse than Williams and Babe Ruth 

It’s also important to note that Trout hasn’t had his down years yet. Pujols had a 170 OPS+ in STL and now has a career 144. Trout’s career averages will most likely drop as well, putting him farther behind.

Degrom has a similar story 

Career ERA+ and innings 
Degrom 157   1261.2 innings 
Kershaw 155  2454.2 innings 
Pedro 154       2827.2 innings 

While Degrom has a higher ERA+ he also has thrown significantly fewer innings. As he continues to pitch and gets injured and worn down his career averages will get worse. 

Kershaw’s ERA+ for the last 4 years are 142, 137, 202(shortened season), 115

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today. There’s a reason every player gets compared to him because there’s none other like the Babe

"Lou Gehrig 1B (1923-1939)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, Triple Crown, 7x all star, 6x World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 113.7WAR, .340/.447/.632, 2721 hits, 493HR, 1995RBIs, 5060TBs, 102SBs

Career highlight: Hitting 4 home runs in a single game

Best season (1927): .373/.474/.765, 218 hits, 47HR, 173RBIs, 52 doubles

Fun fact: Lou was the first athlete to appear on a box of wheaties 

Analysis: Lou was the robin to the Babes Batman who blossomed into the Nightwing of the team. One of the men that paved the way for the hard hitting first baseman he batted like only few in the league at the time. Gehrig was a great hitter with good defense at first and a cornerstone for the Yankees dynasty and a legend for more than just his on field skills

Career stats: 83.8WAR, .284/.370/.538, 2781 hits, 630HRs, 1836RBIs, 184SBs, 5271TBs

Career highlight: going back to back with his dad. 

Best season (1997): .304/.382/.646, 185 hits,  56HRs, 147RBIs, 15SBs

Fun feat: Griffey was the first member of the HoF to hit 40 homers in both the AL (Mariners) and NL (Reds)

Analysis: Griffey is no doubt an icon to the sport. If baseball had a Michael Jordan it’d be Griffey. He was flashy on and off the field, had the talent to boot and was kind to almost everyone he met. He possessed the sweetest swing in baseball and was a true 5 tool player. If you had the blessing of watching him you knew there was never a boring moment. Iconic is the word to describe him.

"Hey guys! If you guys would be so kind as to fill out this survey for me it would be much appreciated. This is for a uni class, it's not being used for any business purpose, but as genuinely and accurately as you can answer would be great. There are no right or wrong answers, it's all your opinion, however try to stay away from extremes such as answering ones or sevens across the board.

The questions are mainly about Joe Buck and John Smoltz as a commentary team, and what kind of factors you like in a commentary team and/or broadcast. All questions are multiple choice, the whole thing should take no more than a couple minutes. Thank you!

Career accolades: 3x MVP, Triple Crown, 20x all star, 7x World Series champion, Gold Glove, Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

Career stats: 81.3WAR, 3.19ERA, 5714Ks (record), 1.25WHIP, 6.6H/9

Career highlight: throwing 7 no hitters

Best season (1973): 21-16, 2.87ERA, 382Ks, 1.23WHIP, 6.6H/9, 10.6K/9

Fun feat: despite being arguably the greatest pitcher of all time Nolan never received the Cy Young award even losing it to his teammate Mike Scott

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well… except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he’s the perfect pitcher

Hank Aaron RF, 1B (1954-1976)

career accolades: MVP, World Series Champion, 25x all star, 2x batting title, 3x gold glove, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career.

Ted Williams LF (1939-1960)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 2x Triple Crown, 19x all star, 6x all star, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn’t technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn’t swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book “The Science of Hitting” which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field.

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection.

Career highlight: being the only unanimous hall of famer

Best season (2005): 1.38ERA, 43-47 in saves, 80Ks

Fun feat: Rivera has more saves then fellow HoFers Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage combined

Analysis: for many positions you can make an argument for different players as the greatest but when it comes to the greatest closer ever you can only have one name. Rivera is the best closer of all time while only throwing one pitch. His cutter was a nightmare for opposing hitters and any time he came in you could stop watching cause the game was over but you’d miss one of the best pitchers ever.

Best season (1922): .401/.459/.722, 250 hits, 42HRs, 152RBIs

Fun feat: Hornsby is the only player to win the NL Triple Crown twice

Analysis: Roger is the Ty Cobb of the NL if there ever was one the difference is Hornsby had the pop that Cobb lacked in his bat. A man that was obsessed with hitting he made it his goal to be the best hitter every season he could be. He even refused to read newspapers or go out so he could focus on hitting and this worked as Hornsby owns the highest single season batting average outside the dead ball era. He was a solid fielder at second as well but at the plate he excelled.

Best season (1991): 11.5WAR (most by a SS), .323/.374/.567, 210 hits, 34HRs, 114RBIs

Fun feat: there is a conspiracy that the orioles faked an electrical issue so Cal could keep his game streak alive

Analysis: Cal may not have been one of the most consistent hitters to play the game but his longevity of playing and his glove at short made him a valuable player. Cal was reliable to play and play well. He was never a liability and his best years at the plate made him one of the best SS of all time.

"Hey all, 

I am relatively new to watching MLB, generally being an NFL fan, and I have a few questions regarding the draft because I had heard during a World Series game that one of the pitchers was a 19th-round pick. 

1) Why are there so many rounds in the MLB draft? Given that it has fewer teams and fewer starting players than the NFL, what's the reason for this? 

2) What positions generally go first in the MLB draft and why?

3) Since there are MLB and then the minor leagues, do drafted players automatically go to MLB teams and are immediate starters?

4) If players didn't play in the college sytems, are they free to sign with any team or would they also have to go through the draft? 

5) How popular is the draft among MLB fans? Do MLB fans follow college baseball and anticipate the draft as rabidly as NFL fans? 

6) What other things are there that the average MLB viewer should know about the draft?",0

He was a player good enough to play against players who hated him and to succeed with all the pressure put on him it shows the true value Jackie brought to the sport

He also received many of his major awards in his great 2012 season in which he won his MVP, HA award, SS, and batting title. But other than that year all he has is 3 SS and 1 GG for individual awards.

6 games each vs. all 4 interleague opponents from 1 assigned interleague division = 24 games

(One 3-Game Series Home and One 3-Game Series Away vs each team)

Assigned interleague divisions will rotate annually (4-year cycle). All 4 teams in a division would be assigned the same interleague division.

&amp;#x200B;

4 games vs. interleague ""natural"" rival = 4 games

(One 2-Game Series Home and One 2-Game Series Away).

Would be play on Thursday-Sunday directly after the All-Star break in Mid-July. Thursday and Friday at one ballpark and then Saturday and Sunday at the opposite ballpark.

(Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, etc.)

**THE EXPANDED POSTSEASON:**

&amp;#x200B;

In the new CBA after expansion, 12 teams (6 in each league) would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners plus 2 wild cards would qualify for the postseason.

The 4 division winners would be seeded 1-4 by record. The 2 wild-cards would be seeded 5-6 by record.

&amp;#x200B;

**League Wild card Series (ALWCS &amp; NLWCS):**

The 1 and 2 seeded division winners would get a bye from this round. The 3 and 4 seeded division winners would battle against the 5 and 6 seeded wild-cards. This round would be a best of 3 series with all games in the series being hosted by the division winners. The wild cards would get no home games for this round. (3 seed vs. 6 seed) and (4 seed vs 5 seed).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Divisional Series (ALDS &amp; NLDS):**

(1 seed vs. wild card round winner with worst regular season record)

(2 seed vs. other wild card round winner)

Best of 5 Series (2-2-1 format).

&amp;#x200B;

**League Championship Series (ALCS &amp; NLCS):**

As normal. Best of 7 Series (2-3-2 format).

"Ted Williams LF (1939-1960)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 2x Triple Crown, 19x all star, 6x all star, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn’t technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn’t swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book “The Science of Hitting” which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field.

Ichiro RF (2001-2019)

Career accolades: MVP, Rookie of the Year, 10x all star, 3x silver slugger, 2x batting title, AS MVP

Career stats: 60WAR, .311/.355/.402, 3089 hits, 117HRs, 780RBIs, 509SBs, 3994TBs

Career highlight: Having the most hits in baseball history when combining his stats from MLB and NPB (Japan)

Best season (2001): .350/.381/.457, 242 hits, 8HRs, 56SBs, 69RBIs, MVP (honorable mention to 2004 which may be his greatest individual season but Ichiros accolades and impact on the mariners in ‘01 puts this season on top)

Fun feat: Ichiro became the second player ever to win MVP as a rookie

Analysis: Ichiro is one of the most talented players to step on the field boasting the hitting ability of Pete Rose with plus talent in all aspects of the game even boasting he could hit 40 home runs but felt getting on base helped his team more. He is the baseball home run king when combining his hits in Japan and America he has more hits than Pete Rose and was a threat in two major leagues. Ichiro was fun to not only watch but to be around for his teammates having a great personality and enjoying every moment of the game.

Career Accolades: 15x all star, 5x gold glove, 7x silver slugger, 8x batting title, hall of fame

Career stats: 69.2WAR, .338/.388/.459, 3141 hits, 135HRs, 1138RBIs, 319SBs, 543 doubles, 85 triples

Career Highlight: nearly achieving a .400 batting average before the lockout ended the season. 

Best season: 1987: .370/.447/.511, 218 hits, 56SBs. Honorable mention to the strike shortened season of ‘94 where Gwynn ended with a batting average of .397

Analysis: In a time where the league started moving toward power and the long ball Gwynn showed up and did what he did best. Hit. Gwynn was a prolific contact hitter almost hitting .400 where he would have been the first to do it since Ted Williams. His hitting prowess almost guaranteed him to be a threat at the plate with his speed to cause chaos on the base baths Gwynn succeeded and is an epitome of a great lead off hitter. Another thing Gwynn had to boast was his ability to play the field. Gwynn was a 5x gold glover and with his speed could chase down any ball into the gap.

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career.

I wonder if the reason these ones aren’t the best is they were rushed due to the location change,0
One of the greatest thing about the MLB All Star game is the player wearing their respective team uniforms. Why has MLB continually screwed with them the past few years? The Spy Vs Spy ones 2 years ago were unforgivable.,0

"Last night was the first time I have watched a Home Run Derby in many years. I honestly don't remember the last one I watched, if I had to guess I would say it has been at least 20 years since I have watched one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I watched it on the MLB site, I am not sure if that was the same coverage as what aired on ESPN. I would guess it was a little different because I was able to see most of the hits that the guy (I forget him name) who went against Alonzo in the first round but apparently on ESPN they showed very little of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoyed watching it. It was entertaining, fun and seemed to be a real contest throughout the whole thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I couldn't help but notice is that this is an event where the bracket set up is completely unnecessary. I think it would have made for a much better event if they just let all 8 people hit, the four with the highest number of home runs advanced to the next round, then the top two. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing I thought is that the tie breaker, instead of being three pitches should have been a three ""out"" tie breaker where any thing that is not a home run counted as an out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few observations from someone who hasn't watched in many years. Overall, it was a very fun thing to watch. Looking forward to the game tonight!",0
"Quotes from him:

&gt;The fact that you have a foreign player that doesn’t speak English, that needs an interpreter, believe it or not — I think contributes to harming the game to some degree when that’s your box office appeal. It needs to be somebody like Bryce Harper, Mike Trout — those guys. And unfortunately, at this moment in time, that’s not the case.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Baseball was dying in the 90s. What saved it? It was the home run competition between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Obviously Sammy Sosa, we learned later during his testimony on Capitol Hill, that suddenly he needed an interpreter. You know, ‘baseball been very very good to him,’ you know what I’m saying? That wasn’t enough. He needed an interpreter to speak for him when he was on Capitol Hill. He certainly didn’t need that when he was smacking those home runs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But Mark McGwire basically helped save baseball, because you had a dude that you could put on Wheaties boxes, alright? That can ingratiate himself with the younger generations out there, and had America transfixed on the sport of Major League Baseball. What I’m saying is, that’s not the case. I’m not taking anything away from Ohtani — I know what he’s doing on the field, I know it’s nothing short of spectacular, and I understand that baseball is an international sport itself in terms of participation — but when you talk about an audience gravitating to the tube, to the ballpark, to actually watch you, I don’t think it helps that the number one face is a dude that needs an interpreter so you can understand what thell he’s saying.

I'm a bit surprised there isn't more backlash on this forum, or really much of anywhere on Reddit. It seems pretty cut and dry a racist, xenophobic rant from someone who's had some [awful takes in the past](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/07/29/espn-suspends-stephen-a-smith-for-one-week-after-he-repeatedly-made-inflammatory-comments-about-domestic-abuse/).

"So we’re at the All-star break and things aren’t looking great. Obviously the season is far from over. I feel like this team has a lot of talent. We should remember that the nationals overcame a much bigger deficit in 2019. So why can’t the Yankees? They have the 10th best ERA with a solid bullpen as well. But are ranked 23rd in Runs. They don’t do well enough with runners in scoring position. Cashman claims they’re going to be buyers. I want to see what you all think about my belief in these 3 players they should go for.

Firstly, I think they should think about whit merrifield. He can play a lot of positions. I know he’s another righty but he leads the league in stolen bases and will bunt. I feel like he can be a DJ with speed. Overall, he would bring something different to the lineup which they need. And most importantly, I don’t think they have to give up as much as the next 2 players I’ll talk about. Maybe they’ll trade Voit and move DJ to third, put Gleyber back at second and whit can play SS. 

My next 2 players are outfielders so it would be interesting to see what the yanks would do. I think Jesse winker would be nice. He’s a powerful lefty who can bat for average and would love the short porch (they desperately need a solid lefty in this lineup). I feel like his main issue may be his defense though. 

I also like Joey Gallo. I think they would need to give up more for him because he’s a Jesse Winker with more power. He can easily hit at least 20 homers at Yankee stadium and has a cannon of an arm. Maybe they’ll move him to LF and keep Judge in right. If I’m not mistaken he can play third and first base as well. 

Overall, I can be wrong about what I’m thinking. And there’s plenty of other guys they can go after, like Jose Berrios. Like I said at the beginning though they have solid pitching so I think they should focus on offense. Other notable mentions for offensive production would be Javier Baez, Matt Chapman, and Trevor Story. Who knows what will happen. Maybe my beliefs are wrong but I feel like they’re pretty reasonable. Sorry I wrote such a long post! Thank you to whoever read the whole thing. I’m interest in what y’all think.",0

"in case anybody hasn't seen it Stephen a smith had this to say on Ohtani, 

&gt;*But when you talk about an audience gravitating to the tube or to the ballpark to actually watch you, I don’t think it helps that the number one face is a dude that needs an interpreter so you can understand what the hell he’s saying*

He then goes on to say that if this was bryce harper we'd be talking about baseball 5 days a week.

My problem with what Stephen A said is that even if ohtani knew english, there wouldnt be that much difference in the viewership of MLB. Theyd just find another excuse to say why they don't watch Ohtani (he plays in the west coast, he's too quiet, etc). We had never seen a guy as consistent as Trout and that didn't attract alot of people. Stanton almost hit 60 one year and that didn't attract anybody. Look at what the padres and tatis are doing, Tatis knows english and I don't hear them talking about the Padres. The dodgers vs Padres is the most interesting rivalry in years, they haven't talked about it either. The problem i feel stephen a doesn't understand is that the best way to attract people to watch something is to have someone that the people can relate to. If there is someone from your home state county or town that become somewhat famous (sports, tv, etc) it will cause you to want to watch what this person might become and watch a little more because there is a sense of pride when someone from your area is doing big things. Even if it's a sport you never watch. Every single person feels this way, its a weird subconscience thing I feel like humans have. THere is a basketball player in the NBa who is from my town and he is in a team I rarelyh follow, but the fact that he is from my town ill watch that team just to see how he does. And this is a guy who barely gets minutes. My point is even if Ohtani knew english, since Americans don't feel they can relate to him there wouldn't be that much difference in interest whether he knew english or not.

One thing I slightly agree with Stephen A is, that knowing english would make ohtani more marketable. He already is very marketable, but I think he's be in more national commercials. I know spanish and to be honest sometimes the translators do a poor job at translating word for word what was said. For other languages, I sometimes wonder if the translator is doing his word justice. One person I feel like missed on alot of money was Bartolo Colon beacuse of this. Remember Big Sexy, if Bartolo had done more commercials during that time he would've made so much money. I know he did a few afterwords like the coal commercial and he had one too this year, but he'd be featured in more commercials if he knew english.

"TLDR: There should be more teams in the MLB to fix attendance and interest in the sport. The locations of the teams now leave huge markets in pro-baseball deserts and blackout restrictions make it impossible for large groups of people to watch a team that represents them even remotely. With a team in driving distance, more people would attend the games and take interest in the sport as a whole. 

So, attendance has been miserable in recent years. More and more people seem to be losing interest in the game. They've implemented all sorts of changes to the ball, the bats, the pitchers, etc. to try and make the game more competitive and exciting. They may or may not have succeeded in that but the problem remains. I think the solution is relatively simple and I want to know if I'm missing something obvious. 

Here it is:
There should be ten more teams in the MLB, spread out across the country. With fewer teams than there are in the NFL but with ten times the number of games, entire markets are being missed. The southeast, outside of Florida, has essentially one team to go see, the Atlanta Braves. The northeast has the Seattle Mariners and no one else until San Francisco. I live in North Carolina and would have to drive 5 hours to go see the nearest MLB game. With 162 games in the year, the average baseball fan isn't going to drive 5 hours to see a singular game that, let's be honest, holds little significance on its own for the overall season. Hell, I don't even make the drive and I would consider myself one of the committed fans (though, my team isn't the Braves.) 
On top of that, if you want to stream the game, you're fighting blackouts all over. I know this is a contractual thing with cable, but again, in North Carolina there are 4 teams that are blacked out online, 3 of which don't actually get broadcast on cable. So, if I'm going to watch the most local MLB game, I'll have to either drive 5 hours or pay cable's exorbitant prices to get one team before adding on a baseball package. 
It just seems to me there are massive groups in this country that are in pro-baseball deserts, and to reach them, the best option would be to give them a local team they can actually reach to have pride in.",0

Analysis: the greatest strikeout pitcher to ever play the game and maybe the greatest pitcher to ever play. Nolan has everything you want in a pitchers career. The strikeouts, the longevity and the ERA he was a stud at everything well… except his control. Nolan threw one of the most electric fast balls ever with many saying it was faster than what was actually recorded in game. Ryan could sit down any batter on strikes early in his career and when he lost his strikeout potential he could still get you out in other ways. Ryan is one of the best players to ever play the game and besides his walk issue he’s the perfect pitcher

Career accolades: MVP, ROTY, 17x all star, 3x World Series Champion, 2x gold glove, Silver Slugger, World Series MVP, 3x Batting Title

Career stats: 79.6WAR, .303/.375/.409, 4256 hits, 160HRs, 198SBs, 1314RBIs

Career highlight: breaking Ty Cobb’s hit record

Best season (1973): .338/.401/.437, 230 hits, 5HRs, 64RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Rose is the only player in MLB history to play 500 games at 5 different positions. Those being 1B, 2B, 3B, LF and RF

Analysis: Pete Rose is like if you took Ty Cobb and placed him in the 60-80s. He was a hitters hitter and could see the ball like no one at the time. Charlie Hustle worked his butt off day in and day out as he perfected his hitting mechanics and obsessed with eclipsing Cobbs record. He was valuable at multiple positions while knowing the ins and outs of the game so well he become a manager. Pete was the real deal you can bet on that.

"Cy Young SP (1890-1911)

Career accolades: Triple Crown, World Series Champion, 2x ERA Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 163.6WAR, 2.63ERA, 511 wins (record), 815GS (record), 749CG (record), 1.13WHIP

Career highlight: never winning a Cy Young award… BUT HAVING THE AWARD NAMED AFTER HIM. Holds the records for wins, losses, games started and complete games

Best season (1901): 33-10, 1.62ERA, 38CG, 5SHO, 158Ks

Fun feat: contrary to todays warmup methods and prep to start Cy said he never stretched and would warm up just 3 minutes before the game. 

Analysis: Cy pitched in a time where hitting was not a strong suit for players in the majors but that does not take away his feats. He would pitch complete games and be good to go 130+ pitches deep into games. He had the longevity to mow down batters and would finish most games he started. What holds Cy back is the age he played in but his success cannot be argued. 

vs

Jackie Robinson 2B, 3B, 1B (1945-1956)

Career accolades: MVP, ROTY, 7x all star, World Series champion, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 63.9WAR, .313/.410/.477, 1563 hits, 200SBs, 141HRs, 761RBIs

Career highlight: breaking the color barrier in professional sports and his biggest in game moment. Stealing home in the World Series

Best season (1949): .342/.432/.528, 203 hits, 16HRs, 124RBIs, 37SBs

Fun feat: Jackie broke the color barrier in major league sports in 1947 which is the most fun feat a player could do literally changing history

Analysis: Jackie is a great player, there are some under the assumption that he was overrated but his stats are great especially in his prime he was a spectacle to watch playing the game quickly with his steal of home being a moment in history you still show people today. He was a player good enough to play against players who hated him and to succeed with all the pressure put on him it shows the true value Jackie brought to the sport

"Ty Cobb CF (1905-1928)

Career Accolades: MVP, Triple Crown, 12x Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 151.5WAR, .366/.433/.512, 4189 hits, 117HRs, 212SBs, 1944RBIs, 724 doubles

Career highlight: first ever person voted to the hall of fame with a 98.2% votes in

Best season (1911): .419/.466/.620, 248 hits, 127RBIs, 83SBs. 

Fun feats: Lead every offensive stat in the 1911 season besides home runs

Analysis: Ty Cobb is the start of the hard nose no nonsense player. A man who was said to fight fans and players a like he had the talent to earn him this respect as well. A man with the speed, contact and ability to hit the ball in the gap he was a threat all the time. He was a player that commanded respect and that was shown when he was the first man voted into the MLB Hall of Fame. 


vs

Warren Spahn SP (1942-1965)

Career accolades: Cy Young, 17x all star, World Series champion, 3x ERA title

Career stats: 100.1WAR, 3.09ERA, 2583Ks, 1.20WHIP

Career highlight: being apart of the “best pitched game in baseball” with Juan Marichal

Best season (1953): 23-7, 2.10ERA, 148Ks, 1.06WHIP

Fun feat: Spahn is the most winning left handed pitcher for his career

Analysis: Spahn was a pinnacle of pitching in the 50s being on the top of his game he valued wins more than any stat. He would pride himself in his ability to win. Spahn was a pitcher that would trip up many hitters possibly a 50s Greg Maddux forcing batters to hit ground balls instead of blowing balls by them

"Rickey Henderson LF (1979-2003)

Career accolades: MVP, 10x all star, 2x World Series Champion, Gold Glove, 3x silver slugger, ALCS MVP, hall of fame

Career stats: 111.2WAR, .279/.401/.419, 3055 hits, 297HR, 1406SBs, 2295 runs, 1115RBIs

Career highlight: eclipsing Lou Brock single season stolen base record and then going on to break his career stolen base record solidifying his record as near unbreakable

Best season: Rickey had many strong seasons breaking the single season steal record in 1982 but his best overall season may be 1985: .314/.419/.516, 172 hits, 24HRs, 72RBIs, 80SBs

Fun feat: Rickey’s (1st) distance between him and Lou Brock (2nd) for career steals is the same as Brock and Jimmy Rollins (47th)

Analysis: When people think of Rickey everyone thinks of his speed and think that is what he is all about but Rickey was a great player at the plate. In his time he was only 2nd to Barry Bonds in walks through that span And was a strong presence at the plate hitting .300 multiple times in his career. His speed gave him great range in the OF and his talents to find the gaps and pop a homer every so often made him a player who you look back and watch while looking at his stats and truly know we will never see a player like him again. 

vs

Mickey Mantle CF, 1B (1951-1968)

Career accolades: 3x MVP, Triple Crown, 20x all star, 7x World Series champion, Gold Glove, Batting Title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 110.2WAR, .298/.421/.557, 536HRs, 153SBs, 2415 hits, 1509RBIs

Career highlight: out of many we can choose his memorable home run race with Roger Maris to try to beat the Babes record is one of the best

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

"Ichiro RF (2001-2019)

Career accolades: MVP, Rookie of the Year, 10x all star, 3x silver slugger, 2x batting title, AS MVP

Career stats: 60WAR, .311/.355/.402, 3089 hits, 117HRs, 780RBIs, 509SBs, 3994TBs

Career highlight: Having the most hits in baseball history when combining his stats from MLB and NPB (Japan)

Best season (2001): .350/.381/.457, 242 hits, 8HRs, 56SBs, 69RBIs, MVP (honorable mention to 2004 which may be his greatest individual season but Ichiros accolades and impact on the mariners in ‘01 puts this season on top)

Fun feat: Ichiro became the second player ever to win MVP as a rookie

Analysis: Ichiro is one of the most talented players to step on the field boasting the hitting ability of Pete Rose with plus talent in all aspects of the game even boasting he could hit 40 home runs but felt getting on base helped his team more. He is the baseball home run king when combining his hits in Japan and America he has more hits than Pete Rose and was a threat in two major leagues. Ichiro was fun to not only watch but to be around for his teammates having a great personality and enjoying every moment of the game. 

vs

Pedro Martinez SP (1992-2009)

Career accolades: 3x Cy Young, Triple Crown, 8x all star, World Series Champion, 5x ERA Title, AS MVP, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 83.9WAR, 2.93ERA, 3154Ks, 1.05WHIP, 7.1 h/9

Career highlight: between 1997-2003 Pedro had the best stretch of any pitcher with a 2.20ERA in 201 games

Best season (2000): 18-6, 1.74ERA, .73WHIP, 284Ks, 5.3H/9, 1.3BB/9

Fun feat: after winning his 200th game he had the best winning percentage of any pitcher all time

Analysis: Pedro is arguably the best pitcher of all time. His change up was near unhittable and with a great fastball to set it up and a repertoire that would make any hitter whiff he was the man you wanted on the mound at any time. His stretch from 97-03 is historic and being apart of the 04 Red Sox solidified him as a Boston Legend. He was gross to watch pitch striking out guys left and right he threw the ball as if it were on a string.

"Ted Williams LF (1939-1960)

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 2x Triple Crown, 19x all star, 6x all star, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 122.1WAR, .344/.482/.634, 521HRs, 2654 hits, 1839RBIs, 4884 total bases

Career highlights: last major league player to hit .400 and holds the record for career OBP at .482

Best season: 1941: .406/.553/.735, 185 hits, 37HRs, 120RBIs

Fun feat: Ted Williams was hitting .3995 going into the final day of the season in 1941 but there was debate since it wasn’t technically .400. The Boston star was asked if he wanted to sit out but to stop any doubt that he hit .400 he played both games going 6-8 and finishing the season hitting .406

Analysis: Teddy ballgame. What is there to say. A hitter that commanded so much respect at the plate if he wouldn’t swing at a pitch the umpires would call it a ball because they knew he had that good of an eye they gave it to him. He was feared at the plate so much that people put him with Babe Ruth on the Mount Rushmore of hitters. Ted hit the ball better than many that played the game even writing the book “The Science of Hitting” which many players said helped them understand how to be a better hitter. If there were any downside to his game it was his fielding capability but his bat made up for any mistake in the field. 

vs

Frank Thomas 1B, DH (1990-2008

Career accolades: 2x MVP, 5x all star, 4x silver slugger, batting title, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 73.8WAR, .301/.419/.555, 2468 hits, 521HRs, 1704RBIs, 4550 total bases

Career highlights: winning back to back MVPs in 1993 and 1994

Best season: 1994: .353/.487/.729, 141 hits, 34HRs, 101RBIs

Fun feat: Thomas’ .487OBP was the highest in the AL since… Ted Williams

Analysis: Frank is the epitome of a power bat that you want in your lineup. Where batters like Williams and Mays had the ability Frank also had the look. A tank of a man when he stepped up to the plate his sheer size struck fear into the hearts of pitchers. Add with that his capability to get the bat to the ball being a career .300 hitter Frank was not just a power bat he was a hitter. His downside is again his fielding capability. His size left him slow at first and being a career DH shows where his value was but as a pure hitter he was the man you wanted batting cleanup.

"Tony Gwynn RF (1982-2001)

Career stats: 69.2WAR, .338/.388/.459, 3141 hits, 135HRs, 1138RBIs, 319SBs, 543 doubles, 85 triples

Career Highlight: nearly achieving a .400 batting average before the lockout ended the season. 

Best season: 1987: .370/.447/.511, 218 hits, 56SBs. Honorable mention to the strike shortened season of ‘94 where Gwynn ended with a batting average of .397

Analysis: In a time where the league started moving toward power and the long ball Gwynn showed up and did what he did best. Hit. Gwynn was a prolific contact hitter almost hitting .400 where he would have been the first to do it since Ted Williams. His hitting prowess almost guaranteed him to be a threat at the plate with his speed to cause chaos on the base baths Gwynn succeeded and is an epitome of a great lead off hitter. Another thing Gwynn had to boast was his ability to play the field. Gwynn was a 5x gold glover and with his speed could chase down any ball into the gap. 

vs

Honus Wagner SS, RF, 1B (1897-1917)

Career accolades: World Series Champion, 8x batting title, hall of fame

Career stats: 130.8WAR, .328/.391/.467, 3420 hits, 101 home runs, 723SBs, 1732RBIs, 642 doubles, 252 triples, 4870 total bases

Career highlight: not a career highlight but having one of the rarest baseball card. As well he led the league in stolen bases and RBIs 5 times

Best season: 1908 (considered by win shares the greatest season of all time): .354/.415/.542, 201 hits, 53SBs, 109RBIs

Analysis: playing at a time where the ball would not leave the park as much Honus made it his job to get it in play and do damage. His RBI capability were great for the time as his contact allowed him to score anyone on the field while he possessed the ability to stretch a single into a double then steal third with ease. Wagner is more than his baseball card he is one of the greatest contact hitters with great field and a plus glove at short.

"Hank Aaron RF, 1B (1954-1976)

career accolades: MVP, World Series Champion, 25x all star, 2x batting title, 3x gold glove, Hall of Fame

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Career Highlight: breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record

Best season: 1959: .355 (career high) 223 hits (career high), 46 doubles (career high), .401OBP, .636SLG, 123RBIs, 39HRs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game. Where Bonds had monster seasons hitting home runs* in his career, Hank broke Babes record by consistently hitting home runs throughout his 22 year career. 

vs

Greg Maddux SP (1986-2008)

Career accolades: 4x Cy Young, 8x all star, World Series Champion, 18x gold glover, 4x ERA title, hall of fame

Career stats: 106.6WAR, 3.16ERA, 355 wins, 109CG, 3371K’s, 35SHO

Career Highlight: 76 pitch complete game, having a stat named after him (a Maddux)

Best season: 1995: 19-2 record, 1.63ERA, 181Ks, .81WHIP, 6.7H/9, 1.4BB/9 (Cy Young)

Small analysis: arguably one of the best pitchers in the modern era Maddux made a name for himself not with high velo or strikeout potential but by daring you to hit the ball. Having one of the best sinker/cutter combos in the game with the command to put the ball wherever he wanted Maddux worked hitters with a lot of ground balls and keeping them on their toes by dotting them up. He is the greatest control pitcher of all time and in a world of flame throwers and strikeout pitchers Maddux made his money with control and command

He played for 25 years, was an all-star 17 times, was in the top 10 for MVP voting 10 times and was MVP in 1973.  Rose is the overall hits leader all-time and is second for the most doubles.  He played 5 different positions and lead the league in fielding in 1970, 1974, 1976, and 1980. He won the World Series 3 times and won 3 batting titles.  

Nobody played the game harder.  Nobody played the game better.

If he had died in a car accident the night he retired from playing, he would be a shoe-in for the HOF and should be there as his playing career dictates.  He would be on my Mt. Rushmore of ballplayers.  If Baseball was a person, it would resemble the playing brilliance of Pete Rose.

The land on which Dodger Stadium and the surrounding parking lot sit was cleared because the city cheated people out of their homes. There are pictures of young men being dragged out of their homes by police and mothers being arrested as their young children look on. When the last member of a family was thrown out the door, the bulldozers would move in.All of them being poor spanish people and with no way of fighting [back.Talk](https://back.talk/) about stealing,injustice,and discrimination.

Bat flipping is amazing. I remember knocking out my neighbors teeth growing up with a legendary bat flip.

I have a solution.

Don’t want a hitter to hit a bomb off your infielder? Don’t have your infielder in the game pitching.

Don’t wanna give up a massive bat flip? Pitch better so the hitter doesn’t hit a homer.

"- Pitchers are only allowed 12 seconds to break between each pitch. 
- Once a batter gets to the plate he has 12 seconds to set in or either an out is added discounted etc. 
- Only 5 mound visits both sides per game 
- Keep 3 out 3 strike system.
Reduce the game to 6 innings. 

This will make each game under 2 hours and will keep the fun and accelerate pace

Also make sure to let players celebrate their home runs and tell the media announcers to make it seem memorable and not boring. Amp up the energy.

"*LOOKING TO HAVE A CIVIL CONVERSATION*

I am genuinely curious. I have been a Stros fan my whole life (I know, I know... my team cheated). But I have no clue why Altuve is the target for so many people.

Anyone that has actually followed his career knows that he is probably the most humble guy on the team. He has an amazing story of how he made it to the big leagues. I understand he got caught up in the cheating scandal, but is it understood that he had the lowest percentage of 'bangs' on the team? 2.7% of pitches thrown that to him that season. 22 (!!) out of 886 pitches that he saw. For reference, George Springer received 147 bangs. Even Carlos Correa (I know, another crowd favorite...) said that Altuve did not desire to receive bangs when hitting. The evidence clearly backs that up.

So, with all that being said, why is he the most hated? Is it because he's consistently a solid hitter which makes him an easy target? Is it because of the homerun off of Chapman? Do you all genuinely believe he was wearing a buzzer? Is it most mlb fans that hate him more than the rest of the Astros, or mainly Yankee/Dodger fans?

I realize that this post could seem like I am being hyper-defensive of Altuve. But please believe me when I say I am just simply looking to understand where the hate for him originates from.",0

"I've always been pretty ambivalent as to whether or not pitchers should wear head-gear.  I am in favor of independent decision making, so, I've tended to lean towards letting them decide for themselves.  Tonight, however, that all changed.  I was at a minor league game, Durham Bulls v. Norfolk Tide, and witnessed an awful injury.  The relief pitcher for the Bulls, Tyler Zombro, took an absolute rocket off of his head.  He collapsed in a heap and then had a seizure that seemed to last forever.  Just a terrible scene.  After this, I really think head protection for pitchers need to be mandated.  I am sure there was debate about helmets for batters and, now, its just custom.  I hope we will reach a point soon when protection for pitchers is just a normal part of the game.

Not to mention Bricktown Ballpark can hold a maximum of 10,000 people and in average they usually get around 8,000 people attending Dodgers games.

"Not for his life because I’m not that type of person. But in a dark bar like I’m about to be. I hope there is a moment where he fears for his job, where he has the balls to emerge and say I fucked up. Except it feels like this will be swept under the rug. It’s felt like the machine that is MLB and it’s Media and Umpiring has been against us from the start . I don’t know the exact number Vegas was set to lose if the Dodgers were out and especially if the Giants won the whole thing, but it was substantial. Enough to throw a series? Absolutely and I can’t pretend I haven’t seen it before. Someone said it feels like 02 when the Kings were ousted by the Refs to make way for Kobe and Shaq. From the off, this game felt rigged. People don’t understand in this game a single bad call can skew entire at bats and innings. Take the 4th for example. It is extremely mentally hard borderline fucked to come back from an AB like Kris Bryant’s. Everyone saw that terrible umpiring and there was nothing we could do. The strong are able to say, hey it’s only the 4th, but for most that’s enough to kill a game.
This is part of the magic in baseball, of course. I’m not even advocating for robo umps. I like traditional baseball and we’ve rode that magical wave all year. But this felt manipulative, the last pitch feels like Morales had to end that game while we could. For whatever reason, ie the sports book, the merchandising, the Dodgers 300 million payroll and corrupt city and state officials. 
Anyways, I’m smart enough to know I’ll have to wash this off. My grandpa died 3 days ago at the age of 80 and he was a huge Giants fan. I was able to go to Game 1 and tell him I was there while he was in hospice care. I thought an extra angel in the outfield would be out there last night but it felt more like MLB cronies had their influence. The biased reporting after the fact and the callback to the completely irrelevant Ruf check swing feels like propaganda and brainwash. 
I have a funeral look forward to and no Giants baseball, that’s my problem. I’m not hurting in any weird ways, huge advocate for mental health here. This one stings however and I just wanted to write this.
Have a great day Giants fans. If you’re a real one Pat yourself on the back. And protect Doval!!

"“The Major League Baseball rulebook does not contain an official definition for a checked swing, but defines a swing as ""an attempt to strike at the ball"". It is the decision of the umpire as to whether an attempt was made or not. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls their wrists back are considered in the ruling. Some umpires prefer to use the ""breaking the wrists"" criterion as the method to decide a checked swing: if the wrists ""rolled over"", a swing occurred.”",0
It's way over do for baseball to change their playoff system.  The best teams in the league with the highest wins should have a chance to meet up in the championship series not the divisional series.  Its better for the fans and better for the game.  MLB should get this done in the winter.,0
"I know this is going to be a tired topic after tonight's game but let's be honest. SF vs LA NLDS, first time both teams faced one another in the playoffs with a 136 year rivalry in the rearview. Goes to game 5, a HOFer is on the bump against a team that beat all odds.

Yet this umpiring crew includes: Angel Hernandez, Doug Eddings, Ted Barrett and now, everyone's new  favorite (especially in the Bay Area) Gabe Morales.

Umpires can eject and subsequently even be the basis of a player being fined and suspended. When a player is playing horribly, they are subjected to being demoted and face internal scrutiny.

However, Morales can make that call during, without a doubt, the biggest game of this postseason and will only be faced by mean tweets and so forth. No fine, no demotion, nothing a player is dealt with in a similar position of disappointment.

If the MLB wants to garner more support in viewership and the Umpire Union wants to preserve their credibility, change the rules. Don't let Gabe officiate another game. Stop letting Angel officiate play off games (or MLB games in general). This is seriously insane. And the MLB wonders why this game is constantly bombarded with claims of it being archaic.",0

Dodgers won 18 more reg season games than Braves (plus WC game), 2nd best record in MLB, only one game behind best record. To me, that should be just as ‘worthy’ as winning the worst division in MLB.

"With my team out of the playoffs for the 20th year, it's time to start thinking about the future of the sport. Once the stadium situations in Tampa and Oakland are figured out, the MLB will be looking to expand to 32 teams.

First of all, with how badly the city of Oakland handled the Raiders, I think the A's follow their football counterparts to Vegas. With that out of the way, I think the 2 expansion teams will be Portland (partly bias, since I live in the PNW) and Montreal, since they've had a team before. Here's how I see realignment going down:

AMERICAN LEAGUE:
EAST:
Baltimore Orioles
Boston Red Sox
Chicago White Sox
Cleveland Guardians
Detroit Tigers
New York Yankees
Tampa Bay Rays
Toronto Blue Jays

WEST:
Houston Astros
Kansas City Royals
Las Vegas Athletics
Los Angeles Angels
Minnesota Twins
Portland Beavers
Seattle Mariners
Texas Rangers

NATIONAL LEAGUE:
EAST:
Atlanta Braves
Cincinnati Reds
Miami Marlins
Montreal Expos
New York Mets
Philadelphia Phillies
Pittsburgh Pirates
Washington Nationals

WEST:
Arizona Diamondbacks
Chicago Cubs
Colorado Rockies
Los Angeles Dodgers
Milwaukee Brewers
San Diego Padres
San Francisco Giants
St. Louis Cardinals

I kept every team in the league they're currently in for simplicity. I also tried to keep divisional rivalries together. I'm sorry if I failed to keep your team with their rivals. I figure going to 8 team divisions would be better than 4 team divisions, because it simplifies the scheduling formula with 12 games against each divisional opponent, 7 games against each opponent in the other division in your league, 3 games against each opponent in one division in the other league, and 4 games against your interleague rival.

"I've had this idea for quite some time now. And with the new-age analytics and strategies, I have been pondering whether this idea would work or not. Personally, I believe it will not only work, but it will transform the game, altering how managers and GMs build rosters and select lineups.

The idea: Spread out the team's best batters, scattered (properly) throughout the lineup. Ideally (but obviously varying based on the team's uniqueness and talent) the lineup would be structured as below.

1. 6th best batter
2. 1st best batter
3. 2nd best batter
4. 7th best batter
5. 3rd best batter
6. 8th best batter
7. 4th best batter
8. 5th best batter
9. 9th best batter

Now absorb the methodology behind tomorrow's roster. By scattering best hitters throughout, the lineup is now more well-rounded and provides for less holes. No more likely ""wasting"" 3 innings a game. This also causes the opposing team to make much more challenging decisions. No more handing the ball to the best guy in the bullpen to get the most challenging part of the order out.

Yes, I know there are two flaws that you archaic minds will refute with. Yes, I understand the purpose of putting your best hitters in the top of the order ensures that they get the maximum number of potential plate appearances. But another flaw people might call out is that this will lower the effectiveness of the top batters, as they can just get pitched around to face the next batter. In this instance though, teams will go through their lineup faster. Plus analytics knows that a successful plate appearance is one that results in someone getting on base, and this will continuously provide that, should opposing teams decide to pitch around the best players (I also believe that much like the death of bunting, pitchers will be less likely to intentionally walk batters, since the odds are in their favor that the batter will get out, no matter how talented the batter is they get out at least 70% of the time). But remember... in this order, there will be only one ""lesser batter"" generally for every two ""better batters.""

This system does provide a greater reliance from the ""lesser batters,"" however they are in the big leagues aren't they? At some points throughout the games/season they will come through. And if not, don't worry, you have another great batter coming up right after.

Let's hear the uproar in responses. You all can remember reading this post though, when 10 years from now this is the new revolutionary system in baseball.

"Someone posted earlier about how a friend thought foul-pole home runs were once-in-a-lifetime events (of course they aren't).  But what really would be a once-in-a-lifetime event?  Americans live on average 78.79 years, and Canadians 82.05 years, so let's call it a round 80 years.

Things we think of as being rare like perfect games and hitting for the cycle really aren't all that rare.  For that matter, even record events like 20 strikeouts aren't all that rare (20 Ks happened twice in one season, even).  And setting the Iron Man record isn't even such an event, because Lou Gehrig set the record 83 years ago and Cal Ripken beat it in 1995, only 63 years later, well within a human lifespan.  So too the single-season home run record was set in 1927, beaten in 1961, again then twice in the '90s-'00s.

I'm sure there have to be some rare things that we'd only expect to see about once in 80 years in MLB.  Any idea of what they could be?

About the only thing I can think of is Johnny Van Der Meer's two consecutive no-hitters in 1938.  Dave Stieb almost did it in 1988, but lost both (one which was perfect to that point, the other a mere no-hitter) with two outs in the ninth inning.

One week after tearing the tendon in his right ankle and getting smoked by the Yankees in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series, Schilling somehow made it back to the mound for Game 6 at Yankee Stadium. It was remarkable that the Red Sox were even still playing, given they had trailed, 3-0, in the series. Schilling underwent an almost barbaric procedure in which his loose tendon was sutured back into place. By the early innings, he had blood pouring through his sock -- yet he was able to fire seven brilliant frames of one-run ball against the Yankees in a 4-2 conquest and force the series to Game 7 -- which the Sox won, of course.

"Hello baseball fans (on reddit)!!! 😀

We are NOW at nearly 50 signatures in this journey to MAKE OUR VOICES heard to MLB players and owners currently negotiating a 2022 CBA suggested to include a UNIVERSAL Designated Hitter rule.

Personally, as a lifelong fan of this game, this truly disheartens me!  How could we be at this place in time where WITHOUT fan input, the powers that be in Major League Baseball are right now deciding the fate of the UNIVERSAL Designated Hitter behind closed doors?

I donno.  But, what I DO KNOW is that I'm NOT gonna go down with the bat on my shoulder!

"Alright so I've had some time to mull over the whole affair, and would like to hear some thoughts on how I've viewed the whole situation. This is gonna be a bit of a read, so buckle up if you want. TLDR is at the bottom. Let's get after it boys.

This post is gonna address three major talking points: The Hall of Fame's apparent lack of consistency around steroid use; why Bonds was not elected; why Ortiz was elected. This is from a Bluejays fan. I've despised Ortiz since I was 5 years old. Take from that what you will.

HoF and Bud Selig:

The hall has appeared inconsistent about their view on steroids. It appears as though they wish to treat steroid use similar to gambling. If you do it, you won't be welcomed in Cooperstown. With that being said, you might well wonder wtf is Bud Selig doing in the Hall of fame then? Only 5 commisioners are. Why would a guy who actively downplayed steroid use be allowed in?

The Mitchel Report was done at the request of Bud Selig. He asked congress to independently look into steroid use. I think this is the Hall's justification on overlooking the steroid scandal in light of everything else he did. He brought baseball back in a time when the MLB was facing serious financial issues. He turned it into a money printing machine. 

Should that absolve him of the years of indifference towards the issue of steroid use? The Hall says yes. I think they are justified in their decision. Other commisioners could have easily continued to sweep it under the rug, or conduct their own sham investigations instead of having a third party (congress) do it. Despite the fact he ignored it, he was ultimately the reason steroid use is now treated the way it is. 

Barry Bonds:

Barry Bonds stained what is arguably the most sacred record in baseball. Achieving the home run record was something that brought world wide fame. Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth are very much symbols of America across the globe. Bonds tainted that record.

Not only did he juice, he [denied it repeatedly](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=3113127). He knew what he was doing was wrong. He is the son of a a former big leaguer. 

He has no place in the Hall and no place in baseball. If Pete Rose set the all time hit record and he's not allowed in, Bonds shouldn't be either. I think this actually reflects well on the Hall.

David Ortiz:

He deserves to be in the Hall. Being a Hall of Fame athlete means being more than a great ball player. It means upholding a high level of ethical standards on the diamond, and off of it.

Ortiz was the face of Boston my entire childhood. He was the guy who took the mic after the bombing and said ""this is our f***ing city"". He was a key part of breaking the curse of the Great Bambino.

It also appears that [while he tested positive, he didn't know that he was using a banned substance](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4385699). Not to mention he willingly gave his urine to be tested.

Am I way off on thinking that the Hall did the right thing?

"Enlighten me with why the league should allow steroid use. I find no good reason and it will only hurt MLB if everyone starts taking steroids.

Steroids are a drug that could potentially harm people in different ways, and could also harm their families as well. Allowing it will cause players to abuse it and could spread to college and high school baseball too.

Players who don’t want to use steroids would be in a significant disadvantage for having the right moral. Baseball is more than just hitting HRs, and besides this past decade the league has recorded total HR records multiple times. I love Ichiro and Ohtani who found creative ways to succeed in the sport. Coincidentally they’re both Japanese players and no Japanese player has been caught for steroids because they know it’s morally right not to use steroids. 

I want the players to be healthy and don’t feel forced to take steroids just to stay in the league. I like singles and having runners on base. I don’t want games to be decided on which team hits more dingers.

And same case for HoF. You can choose to take steroids secretly but once you’re caught you’re not in the HoF, simple. Bonds can keep his 7 MVPs but doesn’t deserve to be HoF and that should be the case for everyone moving on.",0

Out of all the talent to ever step on an MLB field, they pick BABE RUTH as the number 1? Are they serious? Ruth wouldn’t make contact with today’s minor league pitchers. Probably couldn’t do much against college pitching. Listen, he may have been the best player of his era (debatable), but he does NOT belong on a list of the top 100 best players.

3H 3A vs rest own League (6*10=**60**)
7A 7H (3 and 4 game series) vs own Divison (14*4=**56**)

4 + 42 + 60 + 56 = 162 games

"I’m not a fan of it to be fair. Never have. However I have seen plenty of arguments for the shift. Most are focused on why guys can’t hit oppo or bunt it down the line. I saw a good argument that it has increased hitters Homerun or bust mentality to beat the shift in recent years. I believe that to be fairly true. I also see plenty of the same arguments of “why can the hitters not just hit oppo” or bunt it down the opposite line. If this is a played out argument forgive me,but are we ignoring that in shift situations, the pitchers are throwing into the shift. Do you know how hard it is to inside-out a hard inside pitch. Nearly impossible. You get 90+ on the inside part of the plate, professional or not, your only option is to pull the ball into the shift. Clearly I am for outlawing the shift but only to the point that infielders stay on their respective side of 2nd base. However you want to go past that I’m fine.

"With the news Vlad Jr won’t be participating in the HRD, what are some thoughts to change the format. My selfish self wanted to watch Vlad crush the ball in coors field.

I mean, Vlad hit 91 HR in the derby last year and lost to Alonso hitting only 57 HR.

Swinging out of your shoes that many times takes a toll on a guy. Alonso had a slump after he won 19 also. 

So if the HRD format was different would they still be able to attract the best hitters in the league. 

My thoughts:

Basically they should do round 1, everyone gets 20 swings and 3 outs. Whichever comes first. Select the top 4 and Then move on to round 2. Every one gets 20 swings and 3 outs. Select the top two for the final round.

And then it should be 1v1 

Dude A goes up gets 10 pitches
Dude B goes up gets 10 pitches
Dude A goes up gets 10 more
Dude B goes up gets 10 more 
Round of 5 pitches each until someone has their “3 outs”

"Getting rid of sticky stuff will have an unexpected impact on the game; it could screw with the setup man/closer strategy. Teams could need more pitchers on their roster, all because starting pitchers will more often, need to be yanked earlier.

You'd have the same pitcher-innings impact on your roster if you moved the rubber back a foot. 

Batting coaches may need to drop the home run or bust strategy. On the brighter side, with fewer batters constantly swinging for the fences, the infield shift may fall out of favor.

Knocking the wind out of your opponent's bullpen early in your series loses some of its impact when it simply becomes more common.

It's not that teams are looking for complete games, but the formula of your starter getting you 6 or 7 innings to get you to your setup man and then your closer will be more elusive.

Are you going to need more utility players to take up that slack in the roster, fewer development roster slots, Rule 5 draft acquisitions? This could complicate the CBA negotiations coming up this year.",0

I really only watched the Yankees but I was still up to speed on which teams were the best, who the top players were at each position, and just overall dialed in. That was probably 5+ years ago at least. 

Now? I rarely watch even the Yankees. Something just feels off with the MLB over the past years. I saw a post here awhile back that the MLB is slowly turning into how wrestling (WWE) did. Everyone still remembers the golden era of wrestlers but barely the new ones. I feel the same with baseball. I use to be able to sound of the top 5 players at each position without hesitation and that was without even watching much of any team other than the Yankees. Now, I have no idea. I can name you the 2002 Angels lineup still to this day. Rivalries? What rivalries today other than everyone hating the Astros? Everyone can admit (even Yankees fans) that the early to mid 2000s Red Sox team were some of the most exciting baseball teams ever. There was nothing better than a beautiful weekend, BBQing, and having the FOX Yanks/Sox at Fenway game on in the background that is only in the 5th inning after 4hrs and the score is 11-9 with hated stars on each side of the likes of Arod, Jeter, Pedro, Ortiz, Manny, Papelbon, etc. There isn’t a single a player on the Sox today I would stand up at Yankee Stadium and boo aside from the manager Alex Cora.

Then there is the Hr Derby and ASG. I use get so giddy with early July coming and for this to watch. 

Sorry for the long post and would love to hear others thoughts. I know the ratings have been terrible as well. This isn’t a “Hate MLB” thread. This is a game/league I use to love and it’s just sad it is on the wrong path. I would say one of the biggest things they fail with is the marketing of its players. This post doesn’t even touch on the style of play which is also probably the biggest factor.",0

"Hey y’all. Casual baseball fan, just hoping to get some feedback on this question that just came to mind.

What makes HR robberies “top plays”? I understand it’s a play that, if it’s not made, it’s a pretty strong momentum swing for the other team, but strictly athletically speaking, it doesn’t feel like it’s all that special. It’s basically just a jumping catch.

Don’t get me wrong, if the fielder covers some massive distance and it’s a running, jumping, elbow-over-the-wall catch, I understand how that’s a big deal. But ESPN’s top plays from today featured two HR robberies, both of which had the fielder basically setting up at the wall and only having to get their glove over the ledge to make the grab. Why is that a “top play”? Not tryna be a “tough guy”, but I genuinely felt like I could’ve made both of those catches and I haven’t hit the gym in nearly two years.",0

"Framework to overhaul baseball and get a new collective marketing agreement:

My goals: Eliminate tanking, make all owners want to field competitive teams, allow players and owners to equally share in revenue, improve the pace/entertainment of games.

Salaries/Revenue:

\-Owner would need to full open their books to an impartial third party that players agree upon.

\-Owners and players would settle on a % of overall revenues that they would receive - let's say 50%.  This 50% would be divided by the number of teams and be not only a salary cap, but a floor as well (see the next items).  No team could spend more than this amount and would need to take this into account when it comes to in-season trades.

\-Each player would qualify for ML pay credits based on their salary divided by the number of games they are on the active MLB roster for whatever team(s) they are playing throughout the year.

\-At the end of the year, each team's portion of player salaries that was not spent would be divided out and given (based on a ratio of the pay credits formula above) to all players that were on their MLB roster for at least one game to bring that team's salary spend up to the agreed %.

\-Revenue sharing between teams would need to be more like the NFL with all gate/concessions/tv revenue split something like 60/40 by the home/away teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Rules Changes:

\-Add the DH in the National league

\-Institute a pitch clock as well as forcing the batter to stay in the batter's box.  Perhaps give each pitcher and hitter a number of times they can receive exceed this per game without penalty, much like the current limitation on mound visits (SP - 3 times, RP - 1 time, hitter - 1 time).

\-Eliminate the shift and if possible, move back the fences at all parks 10-20 feet to make put more balls in play (less strikeouts/homeruns).

\-Allow unlimited relief pitcher changes (without making them pitch to three batters), but have pitchers to be already in the team dugout and ready to come in instead of having to run in from the dugout.  They will have 30 seconds once they reach the mound to take practice pitches and there will be a picture-in-picture tv commercial like what is done in soccer games instead of cutting away completely.

\-Have a runner starting on second base in extra innings once the game makes it past the 10th inning (only during regular season).

&amp;#x200B;

Re-alignment/interleague play:

\-Add two further teams to get to 32 teams overall, with 4 8-team divisions.

\-Have the top in each 8 team division make the playoffs along with a best of three play-in series from the next two in each division.

\-As there will be salary parity, the un-balanced schedule can remain within each 8-team division, though there should always be at least one home and away series between each team in each league once a year.

\-Remove all interleague play or at most keep a single ""rivalry"" once a year for a home and away series.

&amp;#x200B;

Further radical ideas:

\-Have a ""draft pick"" tournament of all teams that did not make the playoffs to determine the draft order of the first round of the next draft.  Players on teams that did make the playoffs will all be given large enough bonuses to remove any impetus for managers/team wanting them to tank.

\-Change the draft to be more like the NHL draft where high school players are handled.  The rights of such players that are drafted can be held by the team that drafted them until their next draftable time (for high school players, the next period would be after their sophomore year of college like it is now) for a cost of X dollars.  This would bring back a manner of the old draft and follow option that was around a while back and allow teams to take a hedged flyer on a high end high school player and retain their rights through the next draft.  If that player did not sign, they would then go back into the following season's draft (after their Junior season) without restrictions.  Each draft position will have a specific value that is set.  This will eliminate negotiation/holdouts/etc.  Institute an international player draft.

\-Allow managers to give up a full inning of batting for an extra out in a current inning (For example the bases are loaded in the 6th, your team is down 2 runs and a hitter just struck out for the 3rd out.  Instead of losing what might be your best opportunity to tie the game, you bring up another batter, but lose your 9th inning to bat).  This will bring in some strategy to the game with the benefit of possibly shortening games by 1-2 innings, but not doing so arbitrability just to shorten them.",0

"Steroids saved baseball from the strike. Baseball was more fun when you had home run changes. Fans want offense. Look at how the NBA’s popularity exploded when they got rid of certain rules of the 70’s-2000’s era NBA opening the door for exiting teams like Golden State. People say “but muh records”. See the problem with that is baseball relies on the tradition and the past. The nfl and nba doesn’t do that. Tradition is boring and is the reason why nfl and nba is more popular than mlb.

Also this throwing 98 mile an hour fastballs at guys celebrating needs to be punished with 60 game suspensions without pay. You can’t create new super stars if the players are all boring robots who don’t celebrate when they hit a home run or pitch a strike out. 

Also these sports writers have ruined the hall of fame. Who cares if Schilling voted for that stupid orange man? He’s one of the best pitchers ever. Who cares if Bonds and others took steroids? They made mlb lots of money in merchandise sales.",0

"The 2015 Playoffs were pretty great, got to see the Royals ride a great core to another AL championship and actually finish off it and win a WS over the Mets. However, possibly the biggest story of the playoffs was Daniel Murphy. Murphy had always been a solid hitter with mediocre defense which made him a solid MLB starter at 2nd for the first half of his career, in 2015 he posted a .281/.322/.770 slash line with 14 HRs and 73 RBIs for a total 1.9 (Baseball reference numbers) oWAR and 1.2 WAR total. However in the 2015 postseason Daniel Murphy went crazy, in 14 games hitting .328/.391/1.115 with 7 HRs and basically dragged the Mets past the Cubs and the Dodgers. His postseason led to the start of the Statcast or Launch angle era where players began selling out to loft the ball leading to the 3 true outcome baseball we now days watch. To me I hate this type of baseball, being a mid-90s kid I personally think the best baseball I have watched was from 2007 to 2015. This was more traditional offensive baseball so I want to look at two players who played a premium defensive position one from Pre- Statcast era and one that occurred during the Statcast Era. When out of primary position they played at positions that their oWAR would be affected due to the expected offensive production by an average player.

Player A- Pre-Statcast- 136 games played at primary position, 20 played out of position for 156 games total- Slash - .301/.373/.837 with 13 homers, 69 RBIs, 53 doubles, and 73 runs. 

Player B- Post-Statcast-  120 games started at primary position with 124 games played total at position, 40 games started out of position playing in 161 games total. Slashed- .273/.316/.859 with 48 homeruns, 121 RBIs, 24 doubles, 88 runs.

Player A produced oWAR of 5.6, while Player B produced an oWAR of 4.6.

Player A was Johnathan Lucroy's fantastic 2014 season when he was chasing the doubles record and playing great defense behind the plate. 

Player B was Salvador Perez's 2021 year, which I heard people hail as one the best offensive catcher season of all-time. It wasn't close to Lucroy's 2014, granted Perez played more games at DH would have negatively effected his oWAR value, Lucroy's out of position games was at 1st which would have effected his oWAR value as well. 

What does this mean? Well the current offensive philosophy dictates that a low OBP player that mashes homeruns is a measurably worse player then a guy lighter hitter or drills XBH. Even if in this case the player had 35 more homeruns then player who gets on base, gets XBH without trading avg for power. Also a great example for people to look at how flawed the current hitting philosophy is in the MLB. Hope yall enjoy.",0

They push cost cutting to no avail, we are limited on hours so we wont trigger the right to health insurance or other benefits.

I did a bunch of research on the situation and yes I’ve seen the photos. But it’s the fact that the LA district attorney denied this woman’s request to a restraining order, that makes me feel that maybe there’s more moving parts to it.

While I don’t support or condone Bauer’s actions as a human being. And yes he wasn’t found *not* guilty, the charges were just dropped. But for Ozuna it was the opposite, he was actually found guilty (the charges were lowered and then eventually dropped because of some slap on the wrist program), but now he’s fine to play, yet Bauer is still on administrative leave.

Not gonna name names, but ideally each team has a player in the vote, their best bench guy who maybe had less than a certain amount of at bats.

"I grew up loving baseball, and though I was a kid, I still remember going to games at Three Rivers and seeing stars like Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds, Andy VanSlyke, Sid Bream, etc. We've had one good run since those almost glory days. Oddly enough, with the consistently bad performance and terrible ability/lack of desire to onboard and keep good players, why the sam hell do any of you still support this club? I mean, it's fine to root for an underdog, and I get that, and I'm not pissed at the players. I'm disgusted by the management and ownership. Each year we field a team that is hardly better/likely worse than most minor league teams. I've since protested by not giving them any money. Sure, if a pal of mine spends the $5 for seats I'll go with them to enjoy the beautiful field and view of the city, but I'll be damned if I throw any money at this club until they right this ship.

I don't know that much about baseball, but I know there's revenue sharing and other money rolling in that can be spent on at least a few good core players in a league with NO SALARY CAP. 

Hell, just go to Seven Springs to ski. I like the place and it's close for me, but you can tell how cheap the owner is (same owner as the Pirates) because that place is like the fucking Hot Tub Time Machine. All the storage lockers share the same color patterns as the ugly uniform the Astros wore for too long.

Stop giving your money to this club. If you still insist on doing so, please tell me why. This is nuts.

I realize there are a million other things in the world to worry about, but hey, our taxes go to that stadium already, and the Pirates rarely fill the seats unless a really good team comes to town, and that's inexcusable. We should be filling seats to see our own big talent.",0
" 

There was this MLB pitcher named Rick Honeycutt who in 1980 thought he could get away with cheating by taping a thumbtack on his finger to try to scuff the ball and hopefully not get caught. The method didn't work the way he intended as the Umpires did notice marks on the ball and Honeycutt (with the ironic last name) ended up cutting his forehead when he accidentally rubbed it with the hand that had the thumbtack resulting in bleeding. He was ejected and suspended for ten games. 

It's very hard to try to scuff the ball and not get noticed because the Umpires check every single ball throughout the game and if they suspect something, they will immediately approach the pitcher to examine any illegal substance on the pitcher's body. It also doesn't help that the pitcher is constantly being watched on camera and it wouldn't take long for the opponent's manager to notice something on the footage and all he has to do is tell the umpires to examine the pitcher if he suspects something against the rules is happening. 

I got to give credit to Honeycutt for trying something different, but it clearly didn't work the way he intended. I however can't find any video footage of this incident and with it taking place in 1980, you'd think footage would exist.",0

"I think we all agree that having either the Dodgers or Giants forced into a 1 game playoff after dominating the NL all year is nonsense.  In all seriousness I'm guessing someone else has thought of this already but I did just come up with this on my own:

- 6-team playoff per league.

- 3 spots are given to the division winners, the next 3 are given to the 3 best records amongst non division winners.

- Seeding is determined by *record*, not division winners, however.  (Which means if the season ended today, the Giants would be the #1 seed and Dodgers would be #2)

- #1 and #2 seeds get a bye the wildcard round.

- #3 vs #6 and #4 vs #5 in a 3-game, or perhaps even 5-game series.

I think this accomplishes two very important things for MLB.  First, it keeps a team who has dominated the league for an entire season from getting knocked out by an inferior team in one game.  I mean come on now, baseball is numbers game that evens itself out over the course of a season, teams play in *series'* all year long... but now after 162 games it all comes down to ONE?

Secondly, it also sets up a good chance of your two best teams (#1 and #2) having a showdown in the LCS's, which is how it should be.


Bottom line is that no team should have a 1 game playoff for their entire season after grinding for 162 games, but if teams DO have to do that, it certainly shouldn't be the 2nd best team in the league.",0

From what I understand - the bat flip following a homerun is generally frowned upon due to some level of unwritten decorum, right? Almost like it's disrespectful to the pitcher. I've even heard it insinuated and implied that sometimes being overly celebratory can even get hitters beaned in later at-bats. 

On the other hand - it seems like a pretty common place and accepted for pitchers to scream, flex, and posture in celebration after getting a hard strike out; especially to end the inning. Is that not equally ""disrespectful""?

"Hi folks, I am sure I am not the first to think about that, so there might a quick answer out. This is just theoretical thinking about the limits of demotion and promotion of players to the MLB roster. Most teams went with eleven or twelve pitchers on their 25-man roster, and 13 position players. Today it is usually 14 pitchers and 12 fielders, and you see people playing out of position more often than before. Thus my question: is it possible to theoretically create an additional spot for a position player by tactically demoting and promoting pitchers ? E.g. Only four starting pitchers are on the roster. #1 is immediately demoted after his start, while #5 is promoted, and so on ? That would result in one more spot for another player. What are the theoretical limitations for such a scheme ? I suppose number of times someone can be promoted/demoted, minimum duration...May I ask to weigh in ? Thanks.",0

"Hey everyone, I could use some help with this trivia question that has me stumped. Who is the last MLB player, prior to Shohei, who hit at least 7 home runs and pitched 50 innings in the same season? I know for sure it’s not Mike Hampton, someone has done it more recently than him but I have no idea who it is. Been scouring baseball reference as well and can’t find anyone who fits that category either. Any help would be much appreciated!",0

"As an Astros fan myself everyone is always nagging me for liking their team. Even my dad, Whenever i wear my Bregman or Altuve jersey he belts ""CHEATERSSSS"" \[ He is a Mets fan so I always nag him for that\]. 

Why do you hate them? Is it the fact they cheated or that they knew what they we're doing was wrong?   Is it the player's fault? Partially. Or was it Alex Cora's fault. We may never know.

They cheated for only one reason: Victory. They cheated for the glory the fame. Yeah, you could say ""They cheated they are not worthy for the MLB""

Even in 2021 games everyone is still angry at them.

So my point is don't hate them for what they did. Hate them for how they handled it.",0

Once the signal from the manager has been given, the pitcher has \_\_\_\_\_ amount of time to be ready to deliver the pitch to the batter, providing he is ready? There would be enough time for commercials, the pitcher sprinting in and taking as many (or few) pitches as he'd like before the clock expires? Each 30-second interval would be a called ball. Please do not reply about injuries. I've already had it up to here with babying these guys. Cheers",0

I’m a casual Rockies fan, but I don’t really follow the MLB in general very much (aside from the playoffs). Maybe there is an obvious one that is just don’t know about because I follow the league much.

I really believe Yankees finally got what they needed to help the rest of the guys step up during the playoffs . I do believe they should’ve tried to get Mad Max. I personally think it would’ve seal the deal for them.  Seeing that they’ve already had good bats (they just don’t produce good enough in the playoffs imo). But on the bright side my good team the dodgers got the perfect combo from the Nats to ensure their trip back to the WS. They got a 4 head monster rotation if Bauer isn’t suspend the the rest of the season.

&gt;So that, maybe, is your takeaway. If you have a top-end pitcher, you might do well to get some outs in relief in a big spot, because that starter is likely better than the reliever you might otherwise use. If you’re comfortable with that starter going only four or five innings in their next start, then you might not have lost much. But if you had hopes for going deeper than that, you’ve probably cost yourself that opportunity.

"
     I love the Upton brothers, B.J. “Boss man Jr.” (Melvin) and Justin. I know neither of these two are all-time greats, but they are both very special baseball players, and my favorite baseball brothers. 
     B.J. was drafted 2nd overall in 2002, behind Bryan Bullington and before Chris Gruler. He would have the best career of any top 5 pick that year (Grienke was drafted 6th). He debuted two years after being drafted, at the age of 19. As the (Devil) Rays fielded a roster with Scott Kazmir, Upton, Carl Crawford, and Rocco Baldelki, it was easy to be excited for that teams future. B.J. was basically the Byron Buxton of the mid-late 2000’s - all the tools, but inconsistent. He had four 20-20 seasons, stole 40 bases three seasons in a row, and stole 30 five seasons in a row. His time in Atlanta was a disaster, but his final season showed us a glimpse of the younger B.J. when he hit 20 home runs and stole 27 bags, albeit with a .693 OPS. I remember him fondly as a truly exciting player who somehow lost plate discipline as he aged, however disappointing others may view him. 
     Justin Upton was drafted first overall in 2005, an historically loaded top 10. Alex Gordon went 2nd, Ryan Zimmerman 4th, Braun 5th, Tulo 7th; loaded. He would debut two years after being drafted, at 19, in 2007. Although reports of Justin having some of the “best tools of any prospect ever” were plentiful, he bulked up as he aged and never quite showed that elite (6.23 second 60) speed in the majors. Though, he has stolen 15 or more bases 5 times. He has also showed very consistent power accumulating 8 seasons of 25 or more home runs. Like B.J., Justin’s career has largely been seen as a “what-if,” though still more than respectable. 
     My point is this, the Upton’s are special. Two brothers drafted in the top 2 overall, both debuted at 19, both played 10+ years, and yet neither truly lived up to their potential. They are my favorite baseball brothers, and a great reminder that potential doesn’t guarantee a thing.

"So I made a bad parenting decision this weekend. My kid and I are Astros fans living in the PNW. He wanted to go to his first game so we went to the see the Mariners vs the Astros this weekend. We had discussed the whole cheating situation multiple times and talked about how there will be a ton of booing at the game. No problem there. They deserve it. However, I thought the Seattle fans would be a little more chill than LA or Oakland fans.

I have never experienced so much negativity. The crowd that surrounded us harassed us the whole game screaming f\* you every other minute. When my kid showed some excitement when the Astros scored, the fans behind us mocked him. I don't know what kind of person it takes to jump in nine-year old's face and yell f\*ing cheater. Y'all are special. Even when the Mariners scored, they screamed a profusion of profanity. There was no celebrating, just negativity. Is this the state of baseball in the pandemic? 

Please don't take your kids to these games. There is nothing kid friendly no matter if you are a Mariners or an Astros' fan. The father behind me screamed the same stuff in front of his kids. The staff did not care except for when two people get ejected for taunting and screaming at Brantley when he almost got hurt. 

Other than that, I am grateful for the two women who tried to comfort my kid on the way out of the game.",0

Money doesn't guarantee championships, George is gone and so are the days of the yankees buying all the best players and winning multiple series in a row. Who knows who is at fault here whether its ownership, management, the analytics department or the players themselves. You know I don't give a damn if our players are clean shaven, have short hair, and fit the yankees mold. What I care about is can they get outs, get on base, score and play with some heart, fire and tenacity.  I wanna see the players out there having fun, not striking out, walking back to the dugout, and quietly sitting down. When the players are having fun the game is so much more enjoyable to watch.",0

"It feels like Dodger Stadium specifically is the Rockies’ kryptonite. I think I saw a stat last night that said that the Rockies lost 20 of their last 23 games at Dodger Stadium. You could say “well the Rockies just suck and the Dodgers are too good” but I realized that it doesn’t matter how good or bad the Dodgers or Rockies are, the Rockies seem to always get owned at Dodger Stadium no matter the circumstances. 

I am sure we all saw this sweep coming a mile away. Heck, even I knew the Rockies were not winning Game 163 in 2018 simply because it was at Dodger Stadium. The Rockies all time record of 40 games below .500 at Dodger Stadium really speaks for itself too. However when they play at Coors Field, it feels like they are evenly matched most of the time. 

So with that said, I’ve always wondered: why do the Rockies seem to always flop at Dodger Stadium? What is it about that atmosphere that ruins them?",0

"I've been following mlb since the early 90's, and used to play for 14 years. One of the first things as a kid we learned was to always have respect for the uniform. Colours had to be the club colours, even the under shirt.  Nowadays it bothers me to see these young guys in the MLB to have like 2-3 chains around their necks. And the sleeves, they have nothing to do with club colours in many cases. I think it even was forbidden. I mean, in my days if you were noticed, it was because you played the game hard and respectfully. Not for looking like a clown with 2 different sleeves and stutter steps around the bases. Also,  why the batflips? If you strike out 4 times and then hit a homerun, you really shouldn't do that in my opinion, you should be pissed off because you struck out 4 times. Maybe I'm just getting old, but over the last few years for me, baseball is looking more &amp; more like a circus. Which hurts, because I truly love this game.",0

"With five days remaining in Trevor Bauer's current administrative leave, rendered after he was accused of sexual assault, Major League Baseball investigators are pursuing a range of inquiries, according to sources.

Investigators intend to speak with the woman who obtained a restraining order against Bauer last week. To date, MLB investigators have communicated with her lawyer, but hope to speak to her directly, sources said.

In a domestic violence restraining order filed against Bauer last Monday, the woman said Bauer strangled her to the point of unconsciousness during sex on multiple occasions, repeatedly punched her in the face during sex and left her with injuries that required hospitalization. Bauer has denied the accusations.

Investigators are delving into Bauer's history and the question of whether there have been other incidents, sources said, a line of inquiry that MLB has followed in cases subject to the sport's domestic violence policy. At some point, MLB officials would like to speak to Bauer directly, but it is unclear if that will happen any time soon.

The Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher is under criminal investigation by the Pasadena Police Department, and any conversation he has with MLB would be subject to subpoena. The case is expected to be sent to the Pasadena district attorney's office.
Theoretically, Bauer's administrative leave ends on Friday. However, there have been repeated instances in the past that MLB players under criminal investigation have shifted to indefinite leave, to allow time for resolution of the legal matters and for baseball to advance its own inquiries.",0

"Please hear this out from a long time baseball fan.

After Judge's injury last year, Vladdy is reluctant to participate in the Derby this year. No chance their teams want them getting injured, however;  


# What if the HR Derby was...

* 10 Players Derby for 3 Years. 1 Hitter from each team. 30 Teams  


**Every Year**

**2nd Place** = *1 Win, -1 Loss*

**1st Place** = *2 Win, -2 Loss*

&amp;#x200B;

* **TOP 2** from each year play in an 8 man every 4 years, like an Olympic style event.

**1st in Tournament**: *3 Wins, -3 Loss*

**2nd in Tournament**: *2 Wins, -2 Loss*

&amp;#x200B;

Huge incentive for teams to send their stars. Vladdy is going to sit out the Derby and play against Baltimore after. This would make it the other way around. Would be awesome to see Mancini go off and give his team **2 Wins** for participating hard when they're in last place. 

Understandable that in 4 years players can change/get traded, so the team where they won gets the spot in that top 2. Where it is right now teams that are in the playoff race won't send guys.

I do believe also that many MLB players (not at this elite level) can two way but likely don’t because of the upside of being an everyday player outweighs pitching mediocre and putting further health at risk.

"As of right now only the red sox and giants have reached 50 wins within their first 81 games. The dodgers have a chance at their 50th win in their 81st game tonight (july 1st) against the nationals. Assuming they do that would be 3 teams who are barely on pace for 100 wins. 

This year it doesnt feel like any team is dominating in a way to be a clear 100 game winner. My prediction is that this will be the first full 162 game season since 2014 with no 100 game winner. I may be wrong, the giants are the best bet right now, they have 50 wins in 79 games. And there are other teams who were barely short of 50 wins in the first 81 games. I just dont see any team who just missed the mark getting 50+ wins for the rest of the year. And i think teams like the red sox giants and dodgers will just miss the mark as the year ends. Especially as they rest players once divisions are clinched.

"[Three-better minimum rule](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/three-batter-minimum)

&gt;a rule change that requires pitchers to either face a minimum of three batters in an appearance or pitch to the end of a half-inning

If reliever enters the game with 2 outs and the bases empty, retires one hitter, has he satisfied the conditions of the rule and become eligible to leave the game at any time? Could be face exactly one better next inning and then be taken out?

Also, is there any sites that compiles data to show how many times a game has been stopped for a pitching change each year, to track the effect of this rule over time? There are [more pitching changes nowadays](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/126617/mlb-trends-more-home-runs-strikeouts-shifts-pitching-changes), but I'm not sure how many of them actually require a stoppage (as opposed to being made between innings when play was already stopped)",0

"With the MLB situation as it is right now I figured we may have to manufacture some of our own fun in order to enjoy baseball this spring. To that end, I’ve got three words for you: Joe Buck Bot!

That’s right. I’m talking about an AI-powered baseball commentary generator that could provide commentary of any game in the soothing voice and impeccable style of one of the greatest baseball commentators of our time, Joe Buck. 

I see this project having three distinct aims:

1) Voice Synthesizer: Curate a collection of games commentated by Buck. Use these to mine a corpus of speech sounds necessary to generate any sentence in the English language. They did something similar for Roger Ebert. 

2) Play-by-play: Train an algorithm to map pitch-by-pitch data and/or scoresheets to archived video to create natural descriptive commentary that syncs with the action as presented on screen. 

3) Statistical Analysis: Train an algorithm to identify patterns in the game being watched and use those to automate the analysis of relevant historical baseball stats to provide context, highlight potential records in the making, and provide some of the signature zingers and anecdotes Joe is known for.

A little about me: 
I’m a data analyst working for a major government agency. I excel at pivot tables and I’m pretty good with cleaning CSVs in rStudio, so I’m pretty much there technically but I could use a few more hands on deck to help out with most of aims 1, 2, and 3 above.

"1966 NL MVP

The 1966 was possibly Sandy Koufax’s best season, but also his last. Roberto Clemente won his only MVP, as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron finished behind him. It was also the only time in MLB history two brothers both finished top ten in MVP voting. 

The voting went 1) Clemente 2) Koufax 3) Mays 4) Allen 5) Felipe Alou 6) Merichal 7) Regan 8) Aaron 9) Matty Alou 10) Rose.

Roberto Clemente .317/.360/.536 29 HR, 119 RBI, 105 R, 71 XBH

* For the first time in Clemente’s career he broke 100 RBIs in a season, and with the most notable reason being his situational hitting. Clemente led the league with a .400 AVG, .703 SLG and 1.164 OPS (in 204 PA) with RISP. He even kept his AVG at .400 and improved his OPS to 1.195 with two-out and RISP in 65 ABs. Much of Clemente’s value was in the field, as he led NL outfielders by throwing out 17 runners. Clemente finished second in the NL in total bases, extra-base hits and RBIs. The Pirates finished the year in third place, but won 92 games. Clemente’s 29 home runs would be the most he ever hit in a season. 

Sandy Koufax 1.73 ERA, 27-9, 323.0 IP, 317 K

* After winning the 1963 NL MVP and finishing runner-up in 1965, Koufax again finished runner-up in 1966 despite having the most first place votes. Koufax's 317 strikeouts were the fifth most in history, and he became the first pitcher in history to reach 300 strikeouts three different times. Koufax’s 1.73 ERA was the sixth lowest in the Live Ball Era (1920-present). The Dodgers pitching staff gave up only 490 runs in 1966, which was the lowest since World War II and the fifth least in the Live Ball Era (seventh least today). The 95 wins Dodgers clinched the NL by only two games over their rival San Francisco Giants, and without Koufax it's hard to see them doing so as Los Angeles went 29-12 when he pitched and 66-55 in all other games. Koufax led the league in ERA, IP, K, and Wins. Koufax would retire after the season due to an elbow injury, and five years later at age 36 would become the youngest Hall of Famer ever. 

Willie Mays .288/.368/.556 37 HR, 103 RBI, 99 R

* Mays won the 1954 and 1965 NL MVP -- making the largest gap in MLB history between winning the award again. Although just about every NL MVP in the gap years are scrutinized today for Mays not winning the award. The Giants finished two games behind the Dodgers for the NL pennant, which was the exact same scenario the previous season. In 1966 Mays finished third in home runs, fourth in RBIs, fifth in total bases in and sixth in OPS. Mays may not have been quite the player he once was, but he was still among the NL leaders in every statistic. Mays had a .351 AVG with RISP and that rose to .381 with two-out. A highlight included Mays hitting his 512th home run May 4th, setting the all-time National League record, and by the season’s end had the second most in all of baseball history. 

Dick Allen .317/.396/.632 40 HR, 110 RBI, 112 R, 331 TB, 75 XBH

* Allen had a huge offensive season in 1966, leading the league in OPS, slugging and extra-base hits. Allen also finished third in RBIs and OBP while fourth in AVG. He also contributed by hitting .351 with a 1.140 OPS with RISP and those rose to .368 and 1.194 with two-out and RISP. Allen’s season could have been even more productive, but in late April he dislocated his right shoulder and missed three weeks. After returning, Allen moved to left field to hide his throwing arm which would be less effective the rest of his career. He moved back to third base in July, but spent the 1966 season as a defensive liability.

Hank Aaron .279/.356/.539 44 HR, 127 RBI, 117 R, 325 TB

* Aaron led the league in both home runs and RBIs and finished second in runs scored. As the Braves relocated and played their first season in Atlanta many criticized their new ballpark Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for being so hitter friendly due to the dimensions and the heat in Atlanta. This resulted in the ballpark quickly getting the nickname ‘The Launching Pad.’ The Braves scored a league leading 782 runs and 207 home runs -- which were the eighth most in baseball history. While Aaron’s still drove in runs and homered at a league best, his other numbers were not up to his usual high standard. Aaron’s OPS was its lowest since his rookie season, and he set a career low in batting average. 

Felipe Alou .327/.361/.533 31 HR, 74 RBI, 122 R, 218 H, 69 XBH, 355 TB

* Alou had the best season of his 17 year career in 1966, leading the NL in runs, hits and total bases. Alou along with Hank Aaron was part of a Braves team that moved to Atlanta and was criticized for their offensive output being enhanced because of their hitter's park. Yet even on a team with future cooperstown inductees Aaron and Eddie Matthews, Alou was their leading MVP finisher. Although Alou finished second in the batting title, his brother Matty won it by hitting .342 in Pittsburg. Matty also finished ninth in MVP voting. This is the only time in MLB history where two siblings finished first and second in hitting or both top ten in MVP voting.

He is a tech-averse septuagenarian who is chronically late to things and generally doesn’t respect other people’s time. WE are excited for what may be our only visit to Target Field EVER, and so will be entering the park when the gates open. The uncle will not reliably be there.

It seems there is no way to get him his ticket without him downloading and navigating the ballpark app to receive the ticket, and I want to make sure he has the information to do so for when he almost inevitably decides to show up sometime in the second or third inning or whatever.

Give me your opinion On Bryce Harper. Do you love him. Do you think He's a clown. Do You think he's underated. Do you think He's overrated.,0
i am.,0
"Any current or historical examples you can think of? I think the most obvious example today is Bryce Harper; with all the hoopla surrounding him (generational play, most talented ever, etc.), some of which turned out to be slightly overblown, it is easy to forget that the man is on a HOF trajectory: 38.3 fWAR at 28y7m, already had a signature season (2015), and counting stats + accolades (1 MVP, ROTY winner, 6x all-star.) 


My favourite historical example is Joe D. He was erroneously called the ‘greatest living ball-player’ and lionized by the New York media. Had he played elsewhere he would not have been as much of a cultural icon. However, he also happened to play in a park that handicapped him more than any great righty power hitter, ever. 

His career splits at the ol’ Yankee Stadium: .315/.391/.546

On the road: .333/.405/.610

Gosh, was that park ever death for right-handed hitters in those days. Joe D, for what it’s worth, out-averaged Ted Williams on the road and slugged only .005 worse. Granted, the OBP was substantially in Williams favour, but still! Some people consider Williams the greatest hitter ever and JD hit with as much power as him on the road. I can’t think of an all-time great more penalized by their home park. I wonder about the approximate effect it had on his career WAR. If he played in practically any other park and didn’t lose 3 seasons to WW2 I think it’s plausible he’d have amassed 110-120 career WAR. For that reason I think he’s a tad underrated by the analytics community, which tends to rank him in the low 20s nowadays. 

Now, one might say, ‘park factors! They adjust for this stuff’ — well, no, not quite. OYS was a graveyard for righty power hitters, but on aggregate it was not a pitchers park. The short right field porch benefitted lefties substantially. It does not adjust for handedness. 

Now, while I’m a SABRhead I deviate a little from some orthodoxies when ranking players by placing more importance on skill and adjusting for vagaries and happenstance than some. Yes, career value is the most important thing to consider, sure. But, I look at someone like DiMaggio and can’t help but think his skill level exceeded his statistics or accumulated career value (which is legendarily great even with 3 lost prime seasons, 83.6 fWAR) and not for nebulous reasons like ‘he just didn’t live up to his potential’, ‘his head wasn’t screwed on right’, but for some freak anomaly that is both 

a) quantifiable 
b) not adjusted for like overall park factor is 

Does DiMaggio magically become a better baseball player if he hits at, say? Fenway his entire career, where he hit .334/.415/.605 (80 points better than his OPS at home against the Sox)? No! He also doesn’t win all those WS’. Yet, he becomes orders of magnitude more valuable. And that applies to him playing in every other American League park. 

While you can say ‘b-but he should have adjusted!’ — that’s technically true but pushing the limits of what is reasonable to expect from a right-handed power hitter playing in a home park historically unsuited to his talents. Rings similar to ‘pull yourself up by the bootstraps’ — good advice, but hollow. No righty power hitter did. Joe Gordon was LESS of a power/pull hitter than Joe yet he ‘adjusted’ as poorly, if not worse. 

The inverse of this is Jimmie Foxx. He is unanimously remembered as the better hitter, and maybe he was (it could be that he adjusted his swing to his park to such a degree that it radically altered his road stays) but look at his home/road splits: 

Home: .345/.454/.663
Road: .307/.405/.560

Joe has 50 road OPS points on him. They are both right-handed pull hitters, but one played in offensively robust parks for righties, the other did not. Joe is a better hitter and a top 10-15 all-time player, not top 20-25 or any of that jazz. I know gifting unearned career value is like printing money, but I can’t ignore my eyes here and pretend Joe D. is in the Jimmie Foxx tier all-time.  


Just my (radically unorthodox) take. 

TL;DR: Harper should make the HOF at this rate, Joe D. is better than his stats suggest but not cuz of ‘aura’ or ‘Yankee mystique’

Question for all the New Yorkers. Which New York Baseball team has a bigger/Loyal home fan base in NYC Mets or Yankees?,0
"**NOTE:** This is not how I personally want the MLB to look, nor am I guaranteeing that this will happen. This is just a hypothetical on the direction I believe the MLB is headed.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2022, after the new CBA negotiations the DH will become universal and there will be an electronic strike zone.

In 2022, Cleveland Indians name would be changed to the Cleveland Spiders.

In 2025, after the lease on the Coliseum expires after the 2024 season, the Oakland Athletics would relocate to Las Vegas but would keep the same name.

In 2028, after the lease on Tropicana Field expires after the 2027 season, the Tampa Bay Rays would relocate to Montreal and be renamed the Expos.

In 2028, the two expansion teams would be placed in Portland (Beavers) and Nashville (Stars).

In 2028 The 2 leagues would each be realigned into 4 4-team divisions with 1 expansion team in each league.

In 2028, the new Expos would then be swapped to the National League.

In 2028, Colorado Rockies would be swapped to the American League to even things out.

The league will likely want to keep important rivalries such as Yankees-Red Sox, Cubs-Cardinals and Dodgers-Giants. However they probably wont want same city teams such as Yankees-Mets, Cubs-Sox and Dodgers-Angels in the same division.

&amp;#x200B;

The American League:

|AL East|AL North|AL South|AL West|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baltimore Orioles|Chicago White Sox|Colorado Rockies|Las Vegas Athletics|
|Boston Red Sox|Cleveland Spiders|Houston Astros|Los Angeles Angels|
|New York Yankees|Detroit Tigers|Kansas City Royals|Portland Beavers|
|Toronto Blue Jays|Minnesota Twins|Texas Rangers|Seattle Mariners|

&amp;#x200B;

The National League:

|NL East|NL North|NL South|NL West|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Montreal Expos|Chicago Cubs|Atlanta Braves|Arizona D' backs|
|New York Mets|Milwaukee Brewers|Cincinnati Reds|Los Angeles Dodgers|
|Philadelphia Phillies|Pittsburgh Pirates|Miami Marlins|San Diego Padres|
|Washington Nationals|St. Louis Cardinals|Nashville Stars|San Francisco Giants|

&amp;#x200B;

The Regular Season Schedule:

The MLB has long talked about reducing the number of games in the regular season. I feel as though the number they will settle on is 156 games after they expand the league. With the DH becoming universal, the MLB would probably ensure that each team play each team at least once. Here is how I see the schedule breaking down:

12 games each vs. all 3 division opponents = 36 games 

6 games each vs. all 12 non-division opponents = 72 games

3 games each vs. all 16 interleague opponents = 48 games

= 156 game regular season  
Each team would be guaranteed at least 1 off day each week. There would be all 3-game series.

&amp;#x200B;

The Postseason:

The MLB has discussed a 14-team postseason seriously in recent years. With expansion happening, this will probably cement it. Here is how it will likely breakdown:

The 4 division winners would be seeded 1-4 by record within their respective league. The 3 wild card teams would be seeded 5-7 by record within their respective league.

The would be a best of 3 wild card series with all games hosted by the higher seeds (division winners).

The #2 seed vs. #7 seed, the #3 seed vs. #6 seed, the #4 seed vs. #5 seed.   
The #1 seed would get an automatic bye from the wild-card round.

After that, the remainder of the postseason would proceed as normal.",0

"With the VC results being announced in a couple of weeks, I figured it was time we could make predictions on who the Cooperstown class of 2022 will be, so here's mine. I'll start with each committee and then go through each person on the BBWAA ballot.

EARLY BASEBALL ERA COMMITTEE: There's a lot of historic players worthy of consideration (including a giant host of Negro League players), and with this being the committee's first ever meeting it could go any which way. We've got the first African-American minor league player, the Josh Gibson of pitchers, and #4 on the longest hitting streak ranking all in the running. With this first time, though, I have a gut feeling they're going to pick someone who was actually alive at the same time as them, so my money's on either Allie Reynolds or Buck O'Neil getting voted in. 

GOLDEN DAYS ERA COMMITTEE: For this one, I'm mainly going off of previously results. My heart says Roger Maris deserves to be in, and there seems to be a pretty strong following for Minnie Minoso and Dick Allen online. But with how well he did the last time (being a single vote shy of enshrinement), I'm predicting Tony Oliva will be the one to get in, with Jim Kaat a close second (it also helps that they're, you know, alive)

CURT SCHILLING: I'm going to say this right now: Schilling deserves to be in. If Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander are basically locks at this point, Schilling should be that and then some. And to be clear, I HATE his politics. But that shouldn't be the reason why someone doesn't get elected into the Hall. The only real barrier should be if you're a genuine criminal (more on that later). As for whether or not he'll get in, that will depend on how the BBWAA reacts to him famously ""cancelling"" them and asking to be taken off the ballot. Maybe they'll be offended enough to grant his request via voting, or maybe they'll vote him in to spite him. Who even knows, given how fickle the BBWAA is, but with Schilling just under the mark as is it could go either way.

BARRY BONDS AND ROGER CLEMENS: Ooo boy. Yeah, I don't think they're getting in. Not only has MLB refused to pass an olive branch to anyone confirmed to have PEDs, but Bonds and Clemens both refuse to restore their reputation whatsoever (which might actually help two other players, but they're coming later). If they get into the Hall, it will be decades from now when steroids are in the rearview mirror and both players are either pushing daisies or on the cusp of doing so. It really stinks as someone who adored Clemens as a kid, but it's also their own fault.

SCOTT ROLEN: Rolen's been on a massive upward trajectory in the ballots, and it pretty much guarantees he'll get in. If it doesn't happen this year, it'll be next year for sure. 

OMAR VIZQUEL: Remember when I said genuine criminals shouldn't be in the Hall? This is who I was referring to. And apparently the BBWAA agrees with me given his decline in the most recent ballot. Sure there's still five more years for new info on the domestic abuse to come out, and when looking at raw stats he should be in the Hall, but right now, he should not get in based on what we have. It shouldn't happen to him, it shouldn't happen to freaking Trevor Bauer, it shouldn't happen to anybody who does something like that. 

BILLY WAGNER: The BBWAA seems to not know what to do with non-versatile players who weren't constantly in the game, and that includes relief pitchers. Wagner has had a similar rise to Rolen recently, but with two extra retired years on him and slightly less votes, he's in worse shape. If Wagner does get in, it'll be two or three years from now.

TODD HELTON: Helton will get in, but he's in a similar boat as Rolen and Wagner and won't be there for a while. Not that it's so bad in his case since he has a year on Rolen. 

GARY SHEFFIELD: While not as marred by steroids as Bonds and Clemens, he also hasn't posted nearly the number of votes for him to be considered a likely candidate. He's going to fall off in the next few years.

ANDRUW JONES: If it was just his Braves career, he would have been an early pick. But the BBWAA does have to factor in the Dodgers onwards, and those numbers did not help him out at all.

JEFF KENT AND MANNY RAMIREZ: They're way too far down. Kent's practically guaranteed to fall off next year, and Manny Ramirez is in the Bonds and Clemens camp, but with stats that are ""too low"" (compared to Bonds) for any chance of success.

SAMMY SOSA: Goodbye.

ANDY PETTITTE: Also in the Bonds and Clemens camp, along with stats non-comparable to Clemens.

THE RELATIVE NEWCOMERS: I don't see most of them sticking around as indicated by the votes. While Tim Hudson and Bobby Abreu have my vote for eventual VC candidacy, Mark Buehrle wasn't that much of a standout to begin with, and Torii Hunter's relatively lacking stats - not to mention his Latinophobic and homophobic comments - will keep him out as well.

CARL CRAWFORD: He doesn't really have the stats that would warrant a spot in the Hall.

PRINCE FIELDER AND RYAN HOWARD: The BBWAA is obsessed with longevity, and it's a luxury these two didn't have. They'll stick around for a few years and then fall to the wayside, as iconic as they are.

TIM LINCECUM: With how much he contributed to the Giants and his two Cy Young awards, you'd think his WAR would be way higher than it actually is. He'll stick around a bit but will fall off soon afterwards.

JUSTIN MORNEAU: A very popular figure that also did not have the benefit of longevity.

JOE NATHAN: Stats are very low despite a solid career, and that isn't attributable to his Tommy John surgery.

DAVID ORTIZ: Ortiz is the first of the two aforementioned players who will benefit from NOT being in the Bonds and Clemens club. Despite the proof of steroids being there for all to see, and the fact that the BBWAA is supposedly allergic to designated hitters, Ortiz is such a prominent and beloved figure in baseball that he will clear all the hurdles and be elected. If not this year, then in the years after that. 

JONATHAN PAPELBON: A relief pitcher with none of Wagner's stats. Will fall off.

JAKE PEAVY: Peavy has much better stats than most of the other pitchers here, and it will allow him to stick around longer. Longevity's going to be a thorn in his side as well, though in his case it won't matter quite as much.

A.J. Pierzynski: His reputation as an asshole, coupled with ""not quite there"" stats, will keep him out of the Hall.

Alex Rodriguez: Ooo boy again. A-Rod's the other player I think will benefit from not being in the Bonds and Clemens camp - even if he has a foot in. His rather public punishment compared to the other two seems like a death sentence on paper, but A-Rod's post-career has made him a surprisingly popular figure who isn't anywhere near as defensive as Bonds and Clemens. If A-Rod continues playing his cards right, he might actually get in. Bear in mind though, it's NOT happening this year. If it happens, it'll be in his eighth or ninth year on the ballot, given how extensive and publicized his situation has been, especially compared to someone like Ortiz.

JIMMY ROLLINS AND MARK TEIXEIRA: I think most would agree that these two are great players who could and should be in the Hall. It's just not happening this year; probably around Year 5 and 6 for them.",0

Career pitching stats: 94 wins, 2.28ERA, 107CG, 17SHO, 488Ks, 1.16WHIP

Career highlight: the legend of calling his shot. Even though it may not have happened the legend of Babe Ruth is like an American tale and people to this day still know the story

Best season (1923 honorable mention 1927): .393/.545/.764, 205 hits, 41HRs, 130RBIs, 17SBs

Fun feat: The Babe once threw a combined no hitter after starting a game then getting tossed after one out. His reliever proceeded to pitch a no hitter following his ejection. 

Analysis: the Babe is legendary, an American folk tale, the first American celebrity. Everyone knew who he was. He played for the best team and was their best player so he drew a crowd. He leaned into the limelight and loved being a star. All this while his on field play was second to none. He was incredible doing things that we still hear about today.

Career stats: 143.1WAR, .305/.374/.555, 3771 hits, 755HRs, 2297RBIs, 6856TBs

Small analysis: Hank Aaron while boasting the accolade of home run king beating Babe Ruth’s record does not see that as his biggest accomplishment. Aaron says I’m his autobiography that he is proudest about his career .305avg and 3000+ hits. Aaron is one of the most consistent players to ever play the game.

Best season (1952): .353/.464/.705, 188 hits, 52HR, 130RBIs, 10SBs

Fun feat: Mantle was a media darling so much that he was the one people wanted to break Babes single season record. He never did end up doing it but his teammate Roger Maris and him had a home run battle to rival McGwire vs Sosa to beat the Babes record

Analysis: Mickey is one of the GOATs and that cannot be denied. His speed was electric, his fielding was incredible and his ability to hit from both sides of the plate was something many players didn’t find success with at the time. He was a legend not only for the Yankees but in the sport with media talking about how far his home runs would go and how great he was and every bit of it was true. Injuries plagued him his whole career but to many there is none better than the Mick

"Every year it seems like a few teams are screwed by the current system and a few are helped by it. However, you cannot argue that the current system rewards performance during the regular season. 

In 2015, the Cardinals, Pirates, and Cubs had the 3 best records in baseball. They also happened to be in the same division. This means, that not only did they have to play two of the top three teams at a higher proportion than teams outside their division, but when it came time for the playoffs the pirates and Cubs would have to battle it out in a winner take all game for the wild card spot. The 162 game body of work would come down to one game. On top of that, the team with the best record in baseball gets screwed over for having to play the second or third best team. 


This year we are in a similar situation. Are the 88 win Braves more deserving of a playoff spot than the 106 win dodgers? If the dodgers win, does that really reward the giants?

Wouldn’t it be better to have all teams within a league play each other equally? Then when it’s time for the playoffs you can seed based off actual performance. 

I can understand the argument that divisions exist because of the travel requirements, timezones for viewing, existing rivalries. Still teams could easily be realigned by east/west.

"I know they're two different sports, and obviously one has a salary cap, but let's compare the below scenarios.

Los Angeles Dodgers currently have a $267m payroll. That is 2.05x the league average payroll of $130.4m and 1.76x higher than the average of the other 9 playoff teams ($151m).

I think most people would agree that spending this much more than other teams is a pretty significant competitive advantage, and thus there is the competitive balance tax. However, their tax bill is only projected at $17m, which is less than the salaries of 6 individual players on their team.

Now let's compare that with the Golden State Warriors, the NBA team with the highest payroll.

They enter the season with a $177m payroll, which is 1.36x higher than the league average payroll at $130m. A much smaller monetary advantage that will cost them $184m in taxes.

It just seams a bit pointless to even have the tax if it's so insignificant that a team can go well over the threshold ($210m) and really not have any consequences for it. The threshold for the tax being 61% over the league average payroll also seems incredibly insufficient.",0

"Zachary D. Rymer from Bleacher Report makes a good point about where MLB playoffs should go in the future:

[106-Win Wild Card Dodgers Should Be Final Straw for MLB's Broken Playoff Format.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10013654-106-win-wild-card-dodgers-should-be-final-straw-for-mlbs-broken-playoff-format)

&gt;**Either Make it a Wild Card Series or Use Seeds**  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the fundamental problem here is that a team as good as the Dodgers deserves more than just one playoff game, the first question might be why MLB couldn't simply expand the Wild Card Game into a Wild Card Series.  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance, [Joel Sherman](https://nypost.com/2021/09/24/mlb-playoffs-cardinals-dodgers-and-how-to-fix-the-wild-card/) of the New York Post thinks MLB should take a page from the Korean Baseball Organization:  
&gt;  
&gt;*""If the top-seeded wild card finished five or more games better than the lower seeded wild card, then rather than playing just a sudden-death game (as it is now), they would play essentially a best-of-two series in the higher seed’s home stadium in which the higher seed would have to win just once while the lower seed wins twice.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;However, a system like this wouldn't have done the 2021 Dodgers much good. Nor would it solve anything in years in which two excellent teams have to settle for a wild card, like when the 100-win Yankees met the 97-win Oakland Athletics in 2018 or when the 98-win Pittsburgh Pirates met the 97-win Chicago Cubs in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;A simpler way forward would be to have the two wild-card teams play a best-of-three series. A guarantee of two games might barely seem like an improvement on a guarantee of one, but it would at least diminish the likelihood of either contest turning into a Franken-game.  
&gt;  
&gt;As in, a game in which both teams seek out every possible advantage through frequent substitutions that make it seem like an actual chess match more than a baseball game. The [average game](https://www.baseball-reference.com/tools/share.fcgi?id=ODNe7) goes for long enough, typically lasting between 3:05 and 3:10. Between 2012 and 2019, all but four of the Wild Card Games lasted [even longer](https://stathead.com/tiny/2m46q) than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem here is that a Wild Card Series would require the division winners to sit for at least three days. Time off in baseball can be a competitive disadvantage if rust sets in, in which case division winners would actually be punished rather than rewarded.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, perhaps the best thing MLB can do is still have three division winners and a one-game playoff between two wild-card teams, but simply seed teams by their records without prioritizing the division winners. You know, like they do in the National Basketball Association.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I do like the format of the NBA,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said in August, according to [Bill Shaikin](https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2021-08-29/dodgers-mlb-playoffs-format-giants-rockies-nl-standings) of the *Los Angeles Times.* “The two best teams, in the sample of a major league season, should have the best chance of meeting in the postseason, and not just in the first round.”  
&gt;  
&gt;This way, teams like the Dodgers would rightfully get to skip ahead to the Division Series. To make sure division winners still get some reward, though, here's one for the ""Just a Thought"" file: MLB could allow them home-field advantage if they advance past the Wild Card Game.

And make it at least by 8 teams per league (8 from the AL, 8 from the NL). If they have to cut the number of regular season games down to either 120 or 130 for each team to make it happen, so be it.",0

"Lemme use an example. Runner on 1st base steals and the batter hits a high fly ball to the outfield. The runner thinks it’s it line drive to the fence so he touches second and goes to third. By the time the runner reaches third he realizes it’s a pop fly and needs to get back to first. From here I have two questions? On the way back first base can the batter just run by second without touching it? Could he even just run straight across the field, past the pitchers mound to first?",0

"Or any, for that matter. A midget is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “[s]omething that is very small”.  4’10”, to be precise. And while some of you baseball historians may point out the case of Edward Carl Gaedel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gaedel), standing 3’7” on his inconsequential tiptoes and being the shortest person ever to play—who had a single plate appearance in which he walked on four consecutive balls and was then subbed out for a pinch-runner, keep in mind—over the years as the sport has evolved, midgets have quickly vanished from the league. Nowadays the closest person to a midget is Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros (go figure) whose statistics are 5’6”. Not at all a midget; not a smidgen of midget in the whole league. Now, why is this?

I do understand that midgets have some inherent disadvantages. They generally are quite lacking, in fact, with regard to baseball’s crucial traits of strength, speed, and intelligence (although this third one no more than normal people)—as well as, of course, height. But we’ve seen midgets greatly exceed their particular expectations and excel in at least a few sports when given a fair chance. While nothing like the NFL’s football, NHL’s hockey, or NBA’s basketball has turned out all that well for them, consider Olympic gymnastics and horse racing. I... actually can’t think of any others off the top of my head, so maybe not a few sports but a couple at least. They ought to be satisfied with that. If not, maybe they’d be decent at the shot put or javelin throw. 

Anyhow.

Despite all those aforementioned disadvantages, there’s one ironically  BIG offensive advantage to being so little: The strike zone. The strike zone is officially defined as “the area over home plate from the midpoint between a batter's shoulders and the top of the uniform pants -- when the batter is in his stance and prepared to swing at a pitched ball -- and a point just below the kneecap.”  Recall the case of Edward Carl Gaedel. It’s evidently much harder to pitch to a midget. Even if a pitcher manages to throw a strike, a theoretical secondary advantage of the strike zone being even smaller than the midget is that it could know exactly where the pitch is coming. Furthermore, midgets would have far less bad calls against them, as umpires would be able to easily see over them--although that might not matter at all with Joe West, who I’ve heard actually despises midgets but fortunately he is retiring to become a broadcaster next season. All things considered, midgets could force walks and have potential to be great contact hitters, thereby being relevant for about five more years at most.

Aside from the offensive side of the game, midgets could also be very effective on the field. While they certainly wouldn’t be great outfielders due to lack of ability to scale fences and rob home runs, or pitchers due to an increased effective distance to home plate from point of release, midgets have a ton of potential as catchers. One serious issue that catchers have is how their necessary posture puts an enormous amount of strain on their knees; this can lead to many injuries, with meniscus tears, muscle strains, and tendonitis being just a few. So here’s the key: Midgets wouldn’t have to kneel at all. They could just stand there and catch balls—two feet on the ground and two feet off the ground. Catching is in fact the hardest position to play, and a very important one, and for that midgets have my respect.Having a midget on your team could be, defensively, an ironically BIG benefit. Midgets should be fucking fantastic catchers. I’d love to see it.

Midgets also have potential at shortstop.

To conclude, while you absolutely 100% would not want a team full of midgets, midgets could have true niche value in professional baseball. The MLB ought to stop discriminating and give midgets a fair chance. We’ve already seen midgets play at lower levels of the sport, namely little league. Yet even over the last entire decade, I don’t believe I’ve seen a single midget in all the MLB games I have watched. That’s right: Not. A. Single. One (midget).

Maybe I just missed it.",0

"Just as the Yankees were about to start some trouble. The Odor hit I saw a quick clip of the Yankees dugout. The Peralta guy was smirking and gesturing to a team mate, what looked like he was gesturing that the Rays were gonna give this up. The NY tv station covering this only shows that for a second before quickly switching camera. Seemed deliberate.Then soon after with bases 2 and 3 occupied, Rays choose not to walk Judge to load the bases. Which made no sense, it’s the obvious thing to do . By walking Judge they would have set up an automatic out at home with on a hit. A well run team like Tampa should know this better than anyone. Well then Judge hits the ball to 2nd baseman, who throws to home but catcher can’t tag Wade. NYY wins. If Judge was on 1st base, and say Stanton hits that ball, that would be a force out at home. 

The Blue Jays were beating the Orioles 12-2 at that point. The Hottest team in the league. A team that gave Tampa trouble recently. While Tampa has owned NY and Boston pretty much. Now Tampa faces either of these team instead of a surging Blue Jays team.

Does anyone agree?",0

"Alright all.  I'm here with my nerdy spreadsheets so we can have ourselves a nice, concise, easy way of seeing how everything will go based on tomorrow's results.  This will be cross-posted in the main MLB page, and in all teams that need to know how their fates lie.  If I got any details wrong, lemme know.

With Seattle's victory over The The Angels Angels, they are still in the hunt for one of the two AL Wild Card spots.

All games begin at 3:05ET.  There are four teams left in the hunt.  The standings can be found anywhere, but here's the basic lowdown.

In terms of tie-breakers, it depends entirely on how many teams tie, and how many spots there are.

|TEAMS TYING|1 SPOT|2 SPOTS|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2 TEAMS|Game 163, hosted by team with better head-to-head record. **(Scenario 1)**|Both teams advance to Wild Card, team with better head-to-head record hosts. **(Scenario 2)**|
|3 TEAMS|Teams would choose A/B/C designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other two gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record.  Team A hosts Team B, winner goes to Team C, winner of that goes to Wild Card. **(Scenario 3)**|Teams would choose A/B/C designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other two gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record.  Team A hosts Team B, winner goes to Wild Card, loser travels to Team C, winner goes to Wild Card. **(Scenario 4)**|
|4 TEAMS|Teams would choose A/B/C/D designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other three gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record, then the third.  Team A hosts Team B, Team C hosts Team D. Winners play in the ballpark of the superior head-to-head record within them.  Winner of that game goes to the Wild Card. **This has mathematically been ruled out.**|Teams would choose A/B/C/D designations.  Highest head-to-head record against other three gets first choice, followed by the team with the second-best head-to-head record, then the third.  Team A hosts Team B, Team C hosts Team D. Winners go straight to the Wild Card, hosted by the team with the better head-to-head record. **(Scenario 5)**|

If it seems complicated, I get it.  The easiest way to think about it is as a mini one-game tournament bracket, and the teams with the best record get to pick where on that bracket they go.  Now the big question is ""In the event of ties, who has the best head-to-head record?""  Thankfully, this one's rather easy.

|\---|BOS|NYY|SEA|TOR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BOS|\---|10-9|4-3|10-9|
|NYY|9-10|\---|5-2|8-11|
|SEA|3-4|2-5|\---|2-4|
|TOR|9-10|11-8|4-2|\---|

In short, the order of head-to-head tiebreakers will be as follows:  **BOS &gt; TOR &gt; NYY &gt; SEA**

**WHAT THIS MEANS:**

* The **Red Sox** control their own destiny, and ARE guaranteed at least Game 163.  If they win, they are in the Wild Card.  In the event of Games 163/164, they will either host or get first choice of team designation.
* The **Yankees** control their own destiny, and ARE guaranteed at least Game 163.  If they win, they are in the Wild Card.  In the event of Games 163/164, they will not get first choice of designations, and will only host Seattle.
* The **Blue Jays** DO NOT control their own destiny, and require a loss by either the Yankees or Red Sox AND a victory in Game 163/164.
* The **Mariners** DO NOT control their own destiny, and require a loss by either the Yankees and Red Sox, AND a victory in Game 163/164.  In the event of Games 163/164, they are at the whims of all three other teams.

So now comes the fun part:  How do we get to each scenario based on tomorrow's games?  Fortunately, I have a nice little spreadsheet all prepared for this as well.

&amp;#x200B;

|OUTCOMES|BOS-W, NYY-W|BOS-W, NYY-L|BOS-L, NYY-W|BOS-L, NYY-L|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SEA-W, TOR-W|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 3**, (TOR&gt;NYY&gt; SEA)@BOS|**Scenario 3**, (BOS&gt;TOR&gt;SEA)@NYY|**Scenario 5**, BOS&gt;TOR&gt;NYY&gt;SEA|
|SEA-W, TOR-L|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 1**, (SEA@NYY)@BOS|**Scenario 1**, (SEA@BOS)@NYY|**Scenario 4**, BOS&gt;NYY&gt;SEA|

|SEA-L, TOR-L|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|**Scenario 2**, NYY@BOS|

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize everything, here's what you should root for to get the best outcome (either the cleanest path to the wild card game, and/or the bumpiest road for the opponent):

* **If you are a Red Sox fan,** you want the Red Sox to win, Yankees to lose, and Mariners and Blue Jays to win.
* **If you are a Yankees fan,** you want the Yankees to win, Red Sox to lose, and Mariners and Blue Jays to win.
* **If you are a Blue Jays fan,** you want the Jays to win, the Mariners to lose, and either the Red Sox or Yankees to lose, preferably the Yankees.
* **If you are a Seattle Mariners fan,** you want the Mariners to win, either Red Sox or Yankees to lose, and Blue Jays to lose.
* **If you want maximum baseball, maximum drama, or are a Tampa Bay Rays fan,** you want the Red Sox and Yankees to lose, and the Blue Jays and Mariners to win.",0

I say let the #1 seed pick who they want to play in the divisional series. They earned the right, and it will make for some more tasty rivalry if a team gets picked because they are perceived as an easier target.

"Not being a Yankee fan, I never listen to their games. However, like many, the AL wildcard race has been interesting…so I’ve been bouncing around between AL games for all of the contenders.

Usually I would be watching them on MLBTV, however I was driving so had to listen to their radio broadcasts on the internet Most of the teams seem to have comparable broadcast teams…but OMG - what the hell is up with the NY Yankees radio broadcast team?

They seriously could have raffled off tickets to random fans and had more interesting broadcasters! The play by play guy sounded like he is older than my grandfather and we were keeping him up past his bedtime! The so-called “color analyst” was a woman with the personality of wet cement…and offered absolutely NOTHING in terms of analysis! A few bitter comments because the Yankees were losing turned into complete sullenness after the Rays added the last two runs in the 9th.

I expected the broadcasters for the Yankees, of all teams, to be very slick, polished  and ultra-professional! I couldn’t  have anticipated these two in my worst nightmare! New York and the Yankee organization should be utterly embarrassed!

I thought they would be the BEST broadcast team in baseball….instead they are without a doubt THE WORST I have ever heard! I watch and listen to a lot of minor league games as well…and I swear to God, our Sacramento Rivercats (SF Giants AAA team) have better broadcasters than they do!",0

"I don't think that any team that has won 105 games (or more) has ever finished second in their division.  If the Dodgers win at least 2 of 3 vs. Milwaukee, and do not catch SF, they would be the first. And if they do catch SF, then the Giants will be historic losers. 

As a Giants fan, I doubt that would compare to the pain of 1993, when SF  blew a 10-game lead vs. the Braves, won 103 games, but still finished 2nd in the NL West to the 104 win Braves, and missed the playoffs. (Historical note: only three other teams in baseball history ever won 103 or more games and failed to make the playoffs: 1909 Chicago Cubs, '42 Brooklyn Dodgers, and the '54 Yankees.) 

I know people are talking about the Yankees and the AL WC race, but this NL West race is insane.  I cannot recall a divisional race with two teams that both appear to be on pace to win 105+ games closing with such hot streaks. I mean, the Dodgers have been red-hot, winning 15 of their last 18, 83% winning percentage trying to close this gap with SF. But SF have had a closing kick of their own, winning 19 of 23 themselves, which is also an 83% winning percentage (ok, I rounded up from .826%).

"I'm starting to gain a little interest in baseball again for the first time in almost 15 years. I grew up a Red Sox fan in the '00s. Probably watched an average of 150 games/yr from '02-'08 before I gradually started to lose interest in the game (Manny was my favorite player, and once he was traded I started to care less about the Sox).

I'm noticing a ton of players across the league bat in the \~.190-.220 range, lots of guys strike out a ton. I remember back in the day when Adam Dunn was flirting with the 200 strikeouts in a year range, it was a huge deal. Now it seems like even some of the best players in the league get close to that mark. In hindsight, I was probably spoiled by witnessing the primes of all time greats like A-Rod, Manny, Pujols, end of Bonds career, beginning of Miguel Cabrera's career, Vlad, Papi, etc, but all those guys would routinely bat .300 with 40 homers and be closer to 100 k's/yr. Same story with batting averages, I don't remember seeing a non-pitcher start an entire year batting .200. Now I'm noticing a lineup might have several guys batting under .220.

Am I just misremembering the game because I was a fan of a relatively stacked team and witnessed a bunch of all-time greats, or has the game changed in some way that averages are a lot lower and K's are a lot higher? Better pitching, greater emphasis on slugging over average, etc?",0

It’s a Yankees game, and I think that they’re playing the Sox, but I might be wrong.

Does anyone know of a way to watch games without this? Any online feeds?

(if anyone is curious, I dislike it because it's not imparting any information to me. The zone itself is irrelevant live, as only the ump's call matters. Further, it's covering up the live action and makes it more difficult to see catcher positions and the little dot they put up covers where the catcher catches it. On top of it, most pitches are not borderline and most calls are not controversial, so it's telling me literally nothing for the vast majority of pitches. Anyway, rant over)",0

"Can someone explain baseball rules to a total newbie who is not from the US. I can't find normal explanations anywhere and I refuse to believe that it is that hard to grasp a concept of the sport.


-What is an inning? How much time does 1 inning lasts? Do both teams play during the same inning or only one team per inning? How many batters and how many pitchers can play during 1 inning? Can pitcher from one inning throw ball during some other inning too?

-Can you score points without hitting Home run? How do you gain points? Is home run always 2 points? You can only score points while you are a batting team, right?

I've watched couple of full games on youtube and ot seems to me that the players are switching on random. I still didn't caught the pattern on which they switch.

I think that people only need to explain this sport better for it to become more popular or for people to think it is not boring. Sport looks cool to me but all the explanations are so weird and in my country no one is watching or knows anything about baseball.

"1) An agreement could never have been reached in December or January. Period. If they reached a deal in December, the media would have spent the last 2 months declaring one side the winner and criticizing the other for reaching a poor deal with so much time left to negotiate. This would have happened regardless of how fair the deal really was.

2) I support this entire process and, while bummed the season is now delayed, fully support negotiations between organized labor and ownership. I will continue to support profitable ownership and profitable employment because both are vital to ensuring the league continues to exist. I am a fan today and will continue to be a fan whenever the season starts again.

3) The season may not start for several months. The CBA negotiations are about to get complicated by owners introducing a service time reduction for the 2021 season due to missed games. I expect that card to be played by the owners if more games are canceled. When it gets played, I expect the players to walk away from talks for an extended period of time. I also think that was the plan by the owners all along. Which is why the commissioner canceled 2 series right off the bat instead of making each additional day of negotiations equate to one day of the season lost.",0

"If people actually bothered to understand what the lockout is about, they would see that the players are asking for too much. The main issue is Super-2 eligibility. 

If the players had their way, more young players would qualify for super-2 status and earn service time faster. They want 75% of young players to qualify, whereas the MLB has refused to budge from 22% where it has been for decades. If the MLB accepted the MLBPA's proposal of 75%, or even the MLBPA's second offer of 35%, this would mean that instead of  your team controlling your drafted players for 6 years (3 pre-arb years + 3 arbitration years), your team would only have the drafted player for 4-5 years. If your favorite young player wins ROY or MVP, they also gain an additional year of service time, and thus the player reaches free agency even faster. 

This would be TERRIBLE for small market teams and hence why manfred is adamant about keeping the Super-2 eligibility the same. The MLBPA's proposal is good for the player, because he will reach free agency faster and stand to make more money, but bad for the small market team that can't afford them, and bad for the game of baseball. I'm all for players earning more money, but not when it *completely ruins the competitiveness of baseball.* 

The players also want the CBT to be higher, making it easier for large market teams to spend and harder for small market teams to compete. But the players *don't care* because they stand to make more money if the bigger market teams have more cap space. Good for players, bad for the game. 

And yet everyone is taking the players side because ""OwNeRs GrEeDy"". It's quite the opposite actually. The players will sacrifice the competitiveness of the game for a few extra zeros added to the paycheck. Don't believe me? The overwhelming majority of them have *already* left your favorite small market team to go sign the biggest contract offered in NY or LA, and it will only get worse under the MLBPA's proposal. The players say ""we care about the fans and fairness of the game"", when we already know they all eventually leave for the money. It's clearly not about the game, it's about the money. And now they are using their fame and popularity to gain the fans trust and bully the MLB into making a deal that's bad for the game of baseball.

I don't see how anyone who roots for a small market team can take the players side here. Under the player's proposal, the Guardians would have had Lindor for 4 years instead of 6, and somehow they are supposed to compete in a 4 year window around that player, when it was hard enough for them to do it in 6. You see how quickly he left Cleveland and signed with NY? Did he take a smaller contract ""for the fans and fairness of the game""? No, he left town and followed the money immediately. 

The Cubs would have had Kris Bryant for two less years. And KB would have been free to sign with a team who's luxury tax cap was increased with no draft pick compensation going to Chicago. How is this good for the Cubs?? Draft a stud, only have control of him for 4 years (not long enough to build a team around), and watch him leave for LA to take the money, while the Cubs get almost nothing in return. What's the point of the minor leagues and a draft if you're only getting 4-5 years of control on a player? 

Not only has MLB offered to increase young players salary, they have removed draft pick compensation from free agents, they have changed the draft order to avoid tanking, and are openly willing to expand playoffs as well as increase the share of revenues to players. They are even willing to raise the CBT, like the players want. They just won't budge on Super-2 eligibility and I am on their side for this one. I see no way in which increasing Super-2 eligibility is good for the game of baseball. 

If you have any thoughts on the matter I would love to hear them. I am open for healthy debate here. I've been watching the lockout for months. The fact is, the MLB has made several offers inching closer and closer to the player's side, but the players keep getting more and more unreasonable in their demands. What makes me upset is seeing the players use Twitter to denounce the MLB in an attempt to get the fans on their side, when all the fans have to do is understand the issues at hand to see why MLB won't *and shouldn't* budge.",0

"  I'm 61 and been a baseball fan since 1968.  For the first time I'm considering to just be done with MLB. I was looking so forward to the 2022 season it felt like the next era was just beginning for the game. In the end though it is just a game. 

  As a family and mostly Cubs fans we returned to attending ballgames last year after a four year absence due to ticket prices. Last year in groups of 7 to 15 we attended five games in Cincy and Chicago.  Parts of us attended an additional 12 games in Cincy, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, (there is a Braves fan in the family).  Tickets, food, souvenirs, restaurants, gas, airline tickets and motel rooms were purchased. That's a lot of hard earned cash for a middle class extended family to spend and we'll we were looking forward to expanding on that this year. With our April 2nd outing now unlikely and time pressing our scheduled family outings we've now decided to explore and commit to other options.  We surely can't be the only ones. 

  It's very sad but I'm afraid this is a new era alright. The beginning of the end for our national pastime. I mean they've already really have pretty much excluded middle class families from their fanbase by the expense of attending ballgames. Not to mention already having excluded the lower middle class and below previously. I'm disgusted and disappointed MLB and MLBPA. Just a thought as you fight over your share of millions and billions, but if you lose the middle class your going to eventually lose millions and billions. Good luck, tears and likely good riddance.",0

Corey Seager is mine.",0
"Players Union crying over more $$$ while the rest of the country is suffering. Greedy buggers. 

Players are paid only during the regular season, accruing 1/162nd of their salary daily. Players would be subject to losing as much as $232,975 daily in the case of Mets pitcher Max Scherzer, or as little as $3,441 for a player at a $640,000 minimum.

Guess MLB is of my watch list",0
